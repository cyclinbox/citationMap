			"abstract": "In a patient who had metastatic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged lung cancer, resistance to crizotinib developed because of a mutation in the ALK kinase domain. This mutation is predicted to result in a substitution of cysteine by tyrosine at amino acid residue 1156 (C1156Y). Her tumor did not respond to a second-generation ALK inhibitor, but it did respond to lorlatinib (PF-06463922), a third-generation inhibitor. When her tumor relapsed, sequencing of the resistant tumor revealed an ALK L1198F mutation in addition to the C1156Y mutation. The L1198F substitution confers resistance to lorlatinib through steric interference with drug binding. However, L1198F paradoxically enhances binding to crizotinib, negating the effect of C1156Y and resensitizing resistant cancers to crizotinib. The patient received crizotinib again, and her cancer-related symptoms and liver failure resolved. (Funded by Pfizer and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01970865.).",

			"abstract": "Following the results of the CROWN phase III trial, the third-generation macrocyclic ALK inhibitor lorlatinib has been introduced as a salvage option after the failure of a first-line TKI in ALK-rearranged NSCLC, while its precise role in the therapeutic algorithm of ROS1 positive disease is still to be completely defined. The ability to overcome acquired resistance to prior generation TKIs (alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, and crizotinib) and the high intracranial activity in brain metastatic disease thanks to increased blood-brain barrier penetration are the reasons for the growing popularity and interest in this molecule. Nevertheless, the major vulnerability of this drug resides in a peculiar profile of related collateral events, with neurological impairment being the most conflicting and debated clinical issue. The cognitive safety concern, the susceptibility to heterogeneous resistance pathways, and the absence of a valid alternative in the second line are strongly jeopardizing a potential paradigm shift in this oncogene-addicted disease. So, when prescribing lorlatinib, clinicians must face two diametrically opposed characteristics: a great therapeutic potential without the intrinsic limitations of its precursor TKIs, a cytotoxic activity threatened by suboptimal tolerability, and the unavoidable onset of resistance mechanisms we cannot properly manage yet. In this paper, we give a critical point of view on the stepwise introduction of this promising drug into clinical practice, starting from its innovative molecular and biochemical properties to intriguing future developments, without forgetting its weaknesses.",

Here, we investigated the evolution and mechanistic heterogeneity in clonal populations of cell models for estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. To this end, we established barcoded models of luminal breast cancer and rendered them resistant to commonly applied first line endocrine therapies. By isolating single clones from the resistant cell pools and characterizing replicates of individual clones we observed inter- (between cell lines) and intra-tumor (between different clones from the same cell line) heterogeneity. Molecular characterization at RNA and phospho-proteomic levels revealed private clonal activation of the unfolded protein response and respective sensitivity to inhibition of the proteasome, and potentially shared sensitivities for repression of protein kinase C. Our in vitro findings are consistent with tumor-heterogeneity that is observed in breast cancer patients thus highlighting the need to uncover heterogeneity at an individual patient level and to adjust therapies accordingly.",

			"abstract": "Fusions and mutations of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a tyrosine kinase receptor, have been identified in several neoplastic diseases. Rearranged ALK is a driver of tumorigenesis, which activates various signaling pathway associated with proliferation and survival. To date, several agents that target and inhibit ALK have been developed. The most studied ALK-positive disease is non-small cell lung cancer, and three generations of ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been approved for the treatment of metastatic disease. Nevertheless, the use of ALK-TKIs is associated with acquired resistance (resistance mutations, bypass signaling), which leads to disease progression and may require a substitution or introduction of other treatment agents. Understanding of the complex nature and network of resistance mutations may allow to introduce sequential and targeted therapies. In this review, we aim to summarize the efficacy and safety profile of ALK inhibitors, describe off-target anticancer effects, and discuss resistance mechanisms in the context of personalized oncology.",

Therefore, genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening was performed using an ALK+ NSCLC cell line established from pleural effusion without ALK-TKI treatment. After 9 days of ALK-TKI therapy, sequencing analysis was performed, which identified several tumor suppressor genes, such as NF2 or MED12, and multiple candidate genes. Among them, this study focused on ERRFI1, which is known as MIG6 and negatively regulates EGFR signaling. Interestingly, MIG6 loss induced resistance to ALK-TKIs by treatment with quite a low dose of EGF, which is equivalent to plasma concentration, through the upregulation of MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. Combination therapy with ALK-TKIs and anti-EGFR antibodies could overcome the acquired resistance in both in vivo and in vitro models. In addition, this verified that MIG6 loss induces resistance to ROS1-TKIs in ROS1+ cell lines. This study found a potentially novel factor that plays a role in ALK and ROS1-TKI resistance by activating the EGFR pathway with low-dose ligands.",

Starting from the first generation, research rapidly moved to the development of newer, more selective generations of TKIs, obtaining improved results in terms of disease control and survival. However, the use of novel generations of TKIs is not without limitations. We reviewed the main results obtained, as well as the ongoing clinical trials with TKIs in oncogene-addicted NSCLC, together with the biology underlying their potential strengths and limitations. Across driver gene alterations, novel generations of TKIs allowed delayed resistance, prolonged survival, and improved brain penetration compared to previous generations, although with different toxicity profiles, that generally moved their use from further lines to the front-line treatment. However, the anticipated positioning of novel generation TKIs leads to abolishing the possibility of TKI treatment sequencing and any role of previous generations. In addition, under the selective pressure of such more potent drugs, resistant clones emerge harboring more complex and hard-to-target resistance mechanisms. Deeper knowledge of tumor biology and drug properties will help identify new strategies, including combinatorial treatments, to continue improving results in patients with oncogene-addicted NSCLC.",

			"abstract": "Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) alterations (activating mutations, amplifications, and fusions/rearrangements) occur in ~3.3% of cancers. ALK fusions/rearrangements are discerned in >50% of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs) and anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCLs), but only in ~0.2% of other cancers outside of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a rate that may be below the viability threshold of even large-scale treatment trials. Five ALK inhibitors -alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinb, crizotinib, and lorlatinib-are FDA approved for ALK-aberrant NSCLCs, and crizotinib is also approved for ALK-aberrant IMTs and ALCL, including in children. Herein, we review the pharmacologic tractability of ALK alterations, focusing beyond NSCLC. Importantly, the hallmark of approved indications is the presence of ALK fusions/rearrangements, and response rates of ~50-85%. Moreover, there are numerous reports of ALK inhibitor activity in multiple solid and hematologic tumors (e.g., histiocytosis, leiomyosarcoma, lymphoma, myeloma, and colorectal, neuroendocrine, ovarian, pancreatic, renal, and thyroid cancer) bearing ALK fusions/rearrangements. Many reports used crizotinib or alectinib, but each of the approved ALK inhibitors have shown activity. ALK inhibitor activity is also seen in neuroblastoma, which bear ALK mutations (rather than fusions/rearrangements), but response rates are lower (~10-20%). Current data suggests that ALK inhibitors have tissue-agnostic activity in neoplasms bearing ALK fusions/rearrangements.",

			"abstract": "Despite the initial benefit from tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) targeting oncogenic ALK and ROS1 gene fusions in non-small cell lung cancer, complete responses are rare and resistance ultimately emerges from residual tumor cells. Although several acquired resistance mechanisms have been reported at the time of disease progression, adaptative resistance mechanisms that contribute to residual diseases before the outgrowth of tumor cells with acquired resistance are less clear. For the patients who have progressed after TKI treatments, but do not demonstrate ALK/ROS1 kinase mutations, there is a lack of biomarkers to guide effective treatments. Herein, we found that phosphorylation of MIG6, encoded by the ERRFI1 gene, was downregulated by ALK/ROS1 inhibitors as were mRNA levels, thus potentiating EGFR activity to support cell survival as an adaptive resistance mechanism. MIG6 downregulation was sustained following chronic exposure to ALK/ROS1 inhibitors to support the establishment of acquired resistance. A higher ratio of EGFR to MIG6 expression was found in ALK TKI-treated and ALK TKI-resistant tumors and correlated with the poor responsiveness to ALK/ROS1 inhibition in patient-derived cell lines. Furthermore, we identified and validated a MIG6 EGFR-binding domain truncation mutation in mediating resistance to ROS1 inhibitors but sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors. A MIG6 deletion was also found in a patient after progressing to ROS1 inhibition. Collectively, this study identifies MIG6 as a novel regulator for EGFR-mediated adaptive and acquired resistance to ALK/ROS1 inhibitors and suggests EGFR to MIG6 ratios and MIG6-damaging alterations as biomarkers to predict responsiveness to ALK/ROS1 and EGFR inhibitors.",

			"abstract": "Lung cancer is a major cause of cancer-related deaths. Alectinib is the first line of treatment for patients with ALK-positive lung cancer, but the survival rate beyond 2-3\u00a0years is low. Co-targeting secondary oncogenic drivers such as SHP2 is a potential strategy for improving drug efficacy. This is because SHP2 is expressed ubiquitously, but ALK expression is largely restricted to cancer cells. Thus, the combination of ALK and SHP2 inhibitors may provide a way to restrict synergistic cytotoxicity to cancer cells only, by reducing the dose of SHP2 inhibitors required for anticancer action and minimising SHP2-dependent systemic toxicity. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the combination of a SHP2 inhibitor (SHP099) with alectinib would synergistically suppress the growth of ALK-positive lung cancer cells. Our results demonstrated that the drug combination significantly and synergistically decreased cell viability at relatively low concentrations in ALK-positive H3122 and H2228 cells, due to G1 cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis because of suppressed downstream RAS/MAPK signalling. The drug combination also induced the expression of mediators of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, Bim and cleaved caspase-3, and modulated the expression of cell cycle mediators cyclin D1, cyclin B1, and phosphorylated CDK1.",

EML4-ALK variants result from different breakpoints, generating fusions of different sizes and properties. The most common variants (Variant 1 and Variant 3) form cellular compartments with distinct physical properties. The presence of a partial, probably misfolded beta-propeller domain in variant 1 confers solid-like properties to the compartments it forms, greater dependence on Hsp90 for protein stability and higher cell sensitivity to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). These differences translate to the clinic because variant 3, on average, worsens patient prognosis and increases metastatic risk. Latest generation ALK-TKIs are beneficial for most patients with EML4-ALK fusions. However, resistance to ALK inhibitors can occur via point-mutations within the kinase domain of the EML4-ALK fusion, for example G1202R, reducing inhibitor effectiveness. Here, we discuss the biology of EML4-ALK variants, their impact on treatment response, ALK-TKI drug resistance mechanisms and potential combination therapies.",

ALK alterations, including fusions, over-expression and mutations, are highly associated with cancer initiation and progression. This kinase plays an important role in different cancers, from very rare to the more prevalent non-small cell lung cancers. Several ALK inhibitors have been developed and received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. However, like other drugs used in targeted therapies, ALK inhibitors inevitably encounter cancer cell resistance. Therefore, monoclonal antibody screening based on extracellular domain or combination therapies may provide viable alternatives for treating ALK-positive tumors.

Therefore, we focused on the mechanisms underlying adaptive resistance to lorlatinib and therapeutic strategies required to overcome them. We found that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling was involved in the adaptive resistance to lorlatinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC, activation of which was induced by heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor production via c-Jun activation. EGFR inhibition halted ALK-rearranged lung cancer cell proliferation by enhancing ALK inhibition-induced apoptosis via suppression of Bcl-xL. Xenograft models showed that the combination of EGFR inhibitor and lorlatinib considerably suppressed tumor regrowth following cessation of these treatments. This study provides new insights regarding tumor evolution due to EGFR signaling after lorlatinib treatment and the development of combined therapeutic strategies for ALK-rearranged lung cancer.",

			"abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The discovery of tyrosine kinase inhibitors effectively targeting EGFR mutations in lung cancer patients in 2004 represented the beginning of the precision medicine era for this refractory disease. This great progress benefits from the identification of driver gene mutations, and after that, conventional and new technologies such as NGS further illustrated part of the complex molecular pathways of NSCLC. More targetable driver gene mutation identification in NSCLC patients greatly promoted the development of targeted therapy and provided great help for patient outcomes including significantly improved survival time and quality of life. Herein, we review the literature and ongoing clinical trials of NSCLC targeted therapy to address the molecular pathways and targeted intervention progress in NSCLC. In addition, the mutations in EGFR gene, ALK rearrangements, and KRAS mutations in the main sections, and the less common molecular alterations in MET, HER2, BRAF, ROS1, RET, and NTRK are discussed. The main resistance mechanisms of each targeted oncogene are highlighted to demonstrate the current dilemma of targeted therapy in NSCLC. Moreover, we discuss potential\u00a0therapies to overcome the challenges of drug resistance. In this review, we manage to display the current landscape of targetable therapeutic patterns in NSCLC in this era of precision medicine.",

Because of this, there is an unmet need to develop systemic treatments that capitalize on the unique mutational landscape of each patient's tumor. The most frequently mutated protein in cancer, p53, has a role in nearly all cancer subtypes and tumorigenesis stages and therefore is one of the most promising molecular targets for cancer treatment. Unfortunately, drugs targeting p53 have seen little clinical success despite promising preclinical data. Most of these drug compounds target specific aspects of p53 inactivation, such as through inhibiting negative regulation by the mouse double minute (MDM) family of proteins. These treatment strategies fail to address cancer cells' adaptation mechanisms and ignore the impact that p53 loss has on the entire p53 network. However, recent gene therapy successes show that targeting the p53 network and cellular dysfunction caused by p53 inactivation is now possible and may soon translate into successful clinical responses. In this review, we discuss p53 signaling complexities in cancer that have hindered the development and use of p53-targeted drugs. We also describe several current therapeutics reporting promising preclinical and clinical results.",

A total of 228 of these 1050 drugs were identified as cancer therapeutics or cancer-related drugs, and 120 of them were classified as therapeutic drugs for solid tumors according to their initial indications. These drugs have evolved from small molecules with broad-spectrum antitumor properties in the early stage to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and antibody\u2012drug conjugates (ADCs) with a more precise targeting effect during the most recent decade. These drugs have extended indications for other malignancies, constituting a cancer treatment system for monotherapy or combined therapy. However, the available targets are still mainly limited to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), restricting the development of antitumor drugs. In this review, these 120 drugs are summarized and classified according to the initial indications, characteristics, or functions.

			"abstract": "Lorlatinib, a third-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with a broad coverage against ALK mutations, has demonstrated dramatic effects in patients with ALK-rearranged lung cancer. The mechanisms of acquired resistance to lorlatinib by secondary ALK compound mutations have recently been reported; however, resistance mechanisms other than secondary mutations remain unclear. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of the acquired resistance in ALK-rearranged lung cancer cells in vitro. We established two different lorlatinib-resistant ALK-rearranged lung cancer cell lines (H3122LR and A925LLR) via long-term administration of lorlatinib. These resistant cells did not harbor the secondary ALK mutations and showed cross-resistance to the other kinds of ALK-TKIs (crizotinib or alectinib) compared with the parental cells; however, these resistant cells overexpressed the phosphorylated human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3) protein and the ligand of HER3 (neuregulin 1; NRG1). Pharmacological inhibition of HER3 with pan-HER inhibitors or genetic knockdown of HER3 with siRNA resensitized H3122LR and A925LLR cells to lorlatinib in vitro, indicating that H3122LR and A925LLR acquired resistance by NRG1/HER3 activation. These findings demonstrated that targeting NRG1/HER3 is a potential novel therapeutic option for lorlatinib-resistant ALK-rearranged lung cancer.",

Even though experiments revealed the structural hallmarks of the two states, a detailed grasp of the determinants of c-Abl autoinhibition and activation at the atomic level, which may help innovative drug discovery, is still lacking.

			"abstract": "Since the discovery 15 years ago, we have seen a quantum leap in the treatment and survival for individuals diagnosed with ALK+ lung cancers. Unfortunately however, for most, the diagnosis is made in an incurable circumstance given the late presentation of symptoms. Through a revolutionary wave of therapeutics, individuals may remarkably live over a decade, however many fall short of this milestone, as the molecular profile of this disease is very heterogeneous, reflected in variable survival outcomes. Despite a significant improval in survival and quality of life with ALK-inhibitor monotherapies, now available across multiple-generations, drug resistance and disease relapse remains inevitable, and treatment is offered in an empiric, stepwise, non personalised biomarker informed fashion. A proposed future focus to treating ALK to improve the chronicity of this disease and even promote cure, is to deliver a personalised dynamic approach to care, with rational combinations of drugs in conjunction with local ablative therapies to prevent and constantly proactively alter clonal selection. Such an approach would be informed by precision imaging with MRI-brain and FDG-PETs sequentially, and by regular plasma sampling including for circulating tumour DNA sequencing with personalised therapeutic switches occurring prior to the emergence of radiological and clinical relapse. Such an approach to care will require a complete paradigm shift in the way we approach the treatment of advanced cancer, however evidence to date in ALK+ lung cancers, support this new frontier of investigation.",

			"abstract": "The rearrangement of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) occurs in 3%-5% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and confers sensitivity to ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). For the treatment of patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC, various additional ALK-TKIs have been developed. Ceritinib is a second-generation ALK-TKI and has shown great efficacy in the treatment of patients with both newly diagnosed and crizotinib (a first-generation ALK-TKI)-refractory ALK-rearranged NSCLC. However, tumors can also develop ceritinib resistance. This may result from secondary ALK mutations, but other mechanisms responsible for this have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we explored the mechanisms of ceritinib resistance by establishing ceritinib-resistant, echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK-positive H3122 cells and ceritinib-resistant patient-derived cells. We identified a mechanism of ceritinib resistance induced by bypass signals that is mediated by the overexpression and activation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). FGFR3 knockdown by small hairpin RNA or treatment with FGFR inhibitors was found to resensitize the resistant cells to ceritinib in vitro and in vivo. FGFR ligands from either human serum or fetal bovine serum were able to activate FGFR3 and induce ceritinib resistance. A detailed analysis of ceritinib-resistant patient-derived specimens confirmed that tyrosine-protein kinase Met (cMET) amplification induces ceritinib resistance. Amplified cMET counteractivated EGFR and/or Her3 and induced ceritinib resistance. These results reveal multiple ceritinib resistance mechanisms and suggest that ceritinib resistance might be overcome by identifying precise resistance mechanisms.",

From January to December 2018, 34 patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC harboring EGFR T790M mutations were enrolled, and a total of 132 peripheral blood samples were collected. The fragment sizes of EGFR-mutated ctDNAs were significantly shorter than that of their corresponding normal fragments. Osimertinib treatment of patients with shorter EGFR-mutated ctDNA fragments resulted in shorter progression-free survival (PFS). The disappearance time of EGFR-mutated fragment fractions and clonal evolution patterns (new driver mutation group, additional mutation group vs. attenuation group) were each associated with the PFS achieved with osimertinib treatment; however,multivariate analysis revealed that only shorter EGFR-mutated ctDNA fragments were associated with the PFS resulting from osimertinib treatment. EGFR-mutated ctDNA fragment size, time of disappearance of these fragments, and clonal evolution pattern were related to the effects of osimertinib.

			"abstract": "The therapeutic landscape across many cancers has dramatically improved since the introduction of potent targeted agents and immunotherapy. Nonetheless, success of these approaches is too often challenged by the emergence of therapeutic resistance, fueled by intratumoral heterogeneity and the immense evolutionary capacity inherent to cancers. To date, therapeutic strategies have attempted to outpace the evolutionary tempo of cancer but frequently fail, resulting in lack of tumor response and/or relapse. This realization motivates the development of novel therapeutic approaches which constrain evolutionary capacity by reducing the degree of intratumoral heterogeneity prior to treatment. Systematic development of such approaches first requires the ability to comprehensively characterize heterogeneous populations over the course of a perturbation, such as cancer treatment. Within this context, recent advances in functionalized lineage tracing approaches now afford the opportunity to efficiently measure multimodal features of clones within a tumor at single cell resolution, enabling the linkage of these features to clonal fitness over the course of tumor progression and treatment. Collectively, these measurements provide insights into the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of tumors and can thus guide the design of homogenization strategies which aim to funnel heterogeneous cancer cells into known, targetable phenotypic states. We anticipate the development of homogenization therapeutic strategies to better allow for cancer eradication and improved clinical outcomes.",

Numerous EGFR and ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with demonstrated efficacy in patients with EGFR-mutant and ALK-rearranged NSCLCs have been developed, culminating in the availability of the highly effective third-generation TKIs osimertinib and lorlatinib, respectively. Despite their marked efficacy, resistance to these agents remains an unsolved fundamental challenge. Both 'on-target' mechanisms (largely mediated by acquired resistance mutations in the kinase domains of EGFR or ALK) and 'off-target' mechanisms of resistance (mediated by non-target kinase alterations such as bypass signalling activation or phenotypic transformation) have been identified in patients with disease progression on osimertinib or lorlatinib. A growing understanding of the biology and spectrum of these mechanisms of resistance has already begun to inform the development of more effective therapeutic strategies. In this Review, we discuss the development of third-generation EGFR and ALK inhibitors, predominant mechanisms of resistance, and approaches to tackling resistance in the clinic, ranging from novel fourth-generation TKIs to combination regimens and other investigational therapies.",

A more comprehensive understanding of the acquired resistance mechanisms to lorlatinib will enable the development of more efficacious therapeutic strategies.

Here, we show that lorlatinib induced apoptosis and protective autophagy in ALK-positive NSCLC cells. However, the protective autophagy can gradually lead to decreased cytotoxicity of loratinib in ALK-positive NSCLC cells. Meanwhile, we found that the combination of lorlatinib and CQ, an inhibitor of autophagy, inhibited autophagy and promoted apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo, which sensitized cells to lorlatinib through the dephosphorylation of Foxo3a and promoted nuclear translocation, then activation of Foxo3a/Bim axis.

Recently, drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cells have been considered an important seed of acquired resistance cells. In this study, we established lorlatinib intermediate resistant cells from a patient-derived cell model. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibitions significantly suppressed lorlatinib intermediate resistant cell growth. GSK3 inhibition also sensitized acquired resistance cells derived from alectinib-treated patients with or without secondary mutations to lorlatinib. Therefore, GSK3 plays a crucial role in developing acquired resistance against lorlatinib in ALK-positive NSCLC mediated by lorlatinib intermediate resistant cells and could be a potential molecular target to prevent acquired lorlatinib resistance and overcome ALK-TKI resistance.",

In this Review we describe recent developments in proteogenomics and key findings from the proteogenomic analysis of a wide range of cancers. Considerations relevant to the selection and use of samples for proteogenomics and the current technologies used to generate, analyse and integrate proteomic with genomic data are described. Applications of proteogenomics in translational studies and immuno-oncology are rapidly emerging, and the prospect for their full integration into therapeutic trials and clinical care seems bright.",

			"abstract": "Over the last two decades, cancer researchers have taken the promise offered by the Human Genome Project and have expanded its capacity to use sequencing to identify the genomic alterations that give rise to and sustain individual tumors. This expansion has allowed researchers to identify and target highly recurrent alterations in specific cancer contexts, such as EGFR mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (Lynch et al, N Engl J Med 350:2129-2139, 2004; Sharifnia et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 111:18661-18666, 2014), BCR-ABL translocations in chronic myeloid leukemia (Deininger, Pharmacol Rev 55:401-423. https://doi.org/10.1124/pr.55.3.4 , 2003; Druker et al, N Engl J Med 344. 1038-1042, 2001; Druker et al, N Engl J Med 344:1031-1037. https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJM200104053441401 , 2001), or HER2 amplifications in breast cancer (Slamon et al, N Engl J Med 344:783-792. https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJM200103153441101 , 2001; Solca et al, Beyond trastuzumab: second-generation targeted therapies for HER-2-positive breast cancer. In: Sibilia M, Zielinski CC, Bartsch R, Grunt TW (eds) Drugs for HER-2-positive breast cancer. Springer, Basel, pp 91-107, 2011). Despite these advances in our capacity to identify the genetic alterations that drive tumor initiation, survival, and proliferation, our ability to target these alterations to provide effective treatment options for patients in need, particularly those with rare or advanced cancers, remains limited (Gould et al, Nat Med 21:431-439. https://doi.org/10.1038/nm.3853 , 2015). Patient-derived models of cancer offer one potential mechanism to overcome this barrier between the bench and bedside. Through the development and testing of patient-derived models of cancer, functional genomics efforts can identify tumor-specific drug sensitivities and thereby provide a connection between tumor genetics and effective therapeutics for patients in need of treatment options.Recognizing that cancer is a multifaceted set of disease states, the development of personalized models of cancer that can be used to compare treatment options, identify tumor-specific vulnerabilities, and guide clinical decision-making has tremendous potential for improving patient outcomes. This chapter will describe a representative set of patient-derived models of cancer, reviewing each of their strengths and weaknesses and highlighting how selecting a model to suit a specific question or context is critical. Each model comes with a unique set of pros and cons, making them more or less appropriate for each specific research or clinical question. As each model can be leveraged to gain new insights into cancer biology, the key to their deployment is to identify the most appropriate model for a specific context, while carefully considering the strengths and limitations of the selected model. When used appropriately, patient-derived models may prove to be the missing link needed to bring the promise of personalized oncology to fruition in the clinic.",

			"abstract": "Molecular targeted therapies are the standard of care for front-line treatment of metastatic non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) harboring driver gene mutations. However, despite the initial dramatic responses, the emergence of acquired resistance is inevitable. Acquisition of secondary mutations in the target gene (on-target resistance) is one of the major mechanisms of resistance. The mouse pro-B cell line Ba/F3 is dependent on interleukin-3 for survival and proliferation. Upon transduction of a driver gene, Ba/F3 cells become independent of interleukin-3 but dependent on the transduced driver gene. Therefore, the Ba/F3 cell line has been a popular system to generate models with oncogene dependence and vulnerability to specific targeted therapies. These models have been used to estimate oncogenicity of driver mutations or efficacies of molecularly targeted drugs. In addition, Ba/F3 models, together with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis, have been used to derive acquired resistant cells to investigate on-target resistance mechanisms. Here, we reviewed studies that used Ba/F3 models with EGFR mutations, ALK/ROS1/NTRK/RET fusions, MET exon 14 skipping mutations, or KRAS G12C mutations to investigate secondary/tertiary drug resistant mutations. We determined that 68% of resistance mutations reproducibly detected in clinical cases were also found in Ba/F3 models. In addition, sensitivity data generated with Ba/F3 models correlated well with clinical responses to each drug. Ba/F3 models are useful to comprehensively identify potential mutations that induce resistance to molecularly targeted drugs and to explore drugs to overcome the resistance.",

About 3%-5% non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients carry anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene fusions and receive great benefits from ALK-targeted therapy. However, drug resistance inevitably occurs even with the most potent inhibitor drug lorlatinib. About half of the resistance are caused by alteration in ALK proteins for earlier ALK TKI drugs and near one-third of loratinib resistant cases are caused by compound mutations without current effective treatment strategy in clinic. Novel strategies are in great need to overcome drug resistance. Lately, two novel strategies have been developed and attracted great attentions for their potentials to overcome drug resistance problems: (1) developed small compact macrocyclic ALK kinase inhibitors and (2) developed ALK targeted proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) drugs. The macrocyclic molecules are small and compact in size, brain barrier permeable, and highly potent against lorlatinib-resistant compound mutations. Developed ALK targeted PROTAC molecules could degrade oncogenic ALK driver proteins. Some showed superiority in killing ALK positive cancer cells and inhibiting the growth of cells expressing G1202R resistant ALK proteins comparing to inhibitor drugs. The update on these two treatment strategies was reviewed.",

While the global trends in NSCLC incidence have started to decline, we can observe region-dependent differences related to the education and the economic level of the patients. Due to an increasing understanding of NSCLC biology, new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies have been developed, such as the reorganization of histopathological classification or tumor genotyping. Precision medicine is focused on the recognition of a genetic mutation in lung cancer cells called \"driver mutation\" to provide a variety of specific inhibitors of improperly functioning proteins. A rapidly growing group of approved drugs for targeted therapy in NSCLC currently allows the following mutated proteins to be treated: EGFR family (ERBB-1, ERBB-2), ALK, ROS1, MET, RET, NTRK, and RAF. Nevertheless, one of the most frequent NSCLC molecular sub-types remains without successful treatment: the K-Ras protein. In this review, we discuss the current NSCLC landscape treatment focusing on targeted therapy and immunotherapy, including first- and second-line monotherapies, immune checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy treatment, and approved predictive biomarkers.",

Large-scale sequencing of patient-derived cancer samples has identified several druggable driver oncogenes. Many of these oncogenes can be pharmacologically targeted to provide effective therapies for breast cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, melanoma, lymphoma, and other cancer types. Initial responses to these agents can be robust in many cancer types and some patients with cancer experience sustained tumor inhibition. However, resistance to these targeted therapeutics frequently emerges, either from intrinsic or acquired mechanisms, posing a major clinical hurdle for effective treatment. Several resistance mechanisms, both cell autonomous and cell nonautonomous, have been identified in different cancer types. Here we describe how alterations of the transcriptome, transcription factors, DNA, and chromatin regulatory proteins confer resistance to targeted therapeutic agents. We also elaborate on how these studies have identified underlying epigenetic factors that drive drug resistance and oncogenic pathways, with direct implications for the prevention and treatment of drug-resistant cancer.",

Several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been developed for treatment of so-called ALK-positive NSCLC. In cases of tumor progression during treatment with second-generation ALK-TKIs, such as alectinib, brigatinib, or ceritinib, National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines propose a switch to lorlatinib, a third-generation ALK-TKI, or to cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, they do not mention switching to other second-generation ALK-TKIs. Here, we present a rare case of a 53-year-old Japanese woman, who had never smoked, with ALK-positive lung adenocarcinoma who survived alectinib-resistant postoperative recurrence for 4\u2009years by switching to ceritinib. She underwent curative resection for lung adenocarcinoma, but the cancer recurred at the bronchial stump and mediastinal lymph nodes. After platinum-doublet chemotherapy, the patient still had a single growing liver metastasis, but the tumor was found to harbor EML4-ALK rearrangement. Therefore, the patient started to take ALK-TKIs. Alectinib was the second ALK-TKI used to treat this patient. Alectinib shrank the liver metastasis, which was surgically resected. The tumor relapsed again during continued treatment with alectinib, which was switched to ceritinib. Ceritinib was effective for the relapsed tumor and treatment continued well for 4\u2009years. This case report suggests that, in case of tumor progression during treatment with a second-generation ALK-TKI, switching to another second-generation ALK-TKI may be one of the treatment options. Further analyses are warranted to find robust markers to determine which ALK-TKI is best for each patient.",

			"abstract": "Implementation of precision medicine in lung cancer has benefited from intense research in the past years, developing subsequently an improved quality of life and increased overall survival of the patients. Targeted therapy has become one of the most important therapeutic innovations for the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) category with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangement. The aim of this review is to provide a through overview of the main molecules of ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) with their general and particular mechanisms of resistance, the main methods of ALK gene detection, each with advantages and limits and the future perspectives currently under research which try to overcome the mechanisms of resistance. We have used two of the most reliable medical databases EMBASE and PubMed to properly select the latest and the most relevant articles for this topic. Encouraged by the promising results, the clinical practice was enriched by the approval of tyrosine kinase inhibitor molecules, three generations being developed, each one with more powerful agents than the previous ones. Unfortunately, the resistance to TKI eventually occurs and it may be induced by several mechanisms, either known or unknown. Crizotinib was the most intensely studied TKI , becoming the first molecule approved into clinical practice and although four other drugs have been broadly used (alectinib, ceritinib, brigatinib and lorlatinib) it seems that even the most recently developed one remains imperfect due to the resistance mutations that developed. There are two types of resistance generally described for the entire class and for the particular drugs, but half of them remain unknown.",

			"abstract": "Due to the advantages in efficacy and safety compared with traditional chemotherapy drugs, targeted therapeutic drugs have become mainstream cancer treatments. Since the first tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib was approved to enter the market by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2001, an increasing number of small-molecule targeted drugs have been developed for the treatment of malignancies. By December 2020, 89 small-molecule targeted antitumor drugs have been approved by the US FDA and the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of China. Despite great progress, small-molecule targeted anti-cancer drugs still face many challenges, such as a low response rate and drug resistance. To better promote the development of targeted anti-cancer drugs, we conducted a comprehensive review of small-molecule targeted anti-cancer drugs according to the target classification. We present all the approved drugs as well as important drug candidates in clinical trials for each target, discuss the current challenges, and provide insights and perspectives for the research and development of anti-cancer drugs.",

We evaluated crizotinib (ALK/MET inhibitor) and navitoclax (ABT-263; Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor) combinations in a large design consisting of 696 two-cycle sequential and concomitant treatment regimens with varying treatment dose, duration, and drug holiday length over a 26-day period in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells and found that patterns of resistance depend on the schedule and sequence in which the drugs are given. Further, we tracked the clonal dynamics and mechanisms of resistance using DNA-integrated barcodes and single-cell RNA sequencing.

			"abstract": "Glioma is the most common lethal tumor of the human brain. The median survival of patients with primary World Health Organization grade IV glioma is only 14.6 months. The World Health Organization classification of tumors of the central nervous system categorized gliomas into lower-grade gliomas and glioblastomas. Unlike primary glioblastoma that usually develop de novo in the elderly, secondary glioblastoma enriched with an isocitrate dehydrogenase mutant typically progresses from lower-grade glioma within 5-10 years from the time of diagnosis. Based on various evolutional trajectories brought on by clonal and subclonal alterations, the evolution patterns of glioma vary according to different theories. Some important features distinguish the normal brain from other tissues, e.g., the composition of the microenvironment around the tumor cells, the presence of the blood-brain barrier, and others. The underlying mechanism of glioma recurrence and evolution patterns of glioma are different from those of other types of cancer. Several studies correlated tumor recurrence with tumor heterogeneity and the immune microenvironment. However, the detailed reasons for the progression and recurrence of glioma remain controversial. In this review, we introduce the different mechanisms involved in glioma progression, including tumor heterogeneity, the tumor microenvironment and drug resistance, and their pre-clinical implements in clinical trials. This review aimed to provide new insights into further clinical strategies for the treatment of patients with recurrent and secondary glioma.",

However, the extent, origin, and drivers of ITH across cancer types are poorly understood. To address this, we extensively characterize ITH across whole-genome sequences of 2,658 cancer samples spanning 38 cancer types. Nearly all informative samples (95.1%) contain evidence of distinct subclonal expansions with frequent branching relationships between subclones. We observe positive selection of subclonal driver mutations across most cancer types and identify cancer type-specific subclonal patterns of driver gene mutations, fusions, structural variants, and copy number alterations as well as dynamic changes in mutational processes between subclonal expansions. Our results underline the importance of ITH and its drivers in tumor evolution and provide a pan-cancer resource of comprehensively annotated subclonal events from whole-genome sequencing data.",

Two to seven percent of NSCLC patients harbor gene rearrangements of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene or, alternatively, harbor chromosomal fusions of ALK with echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4). The availability of tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting ALK (ALK-TKIs) has significantly improved the progression-free and overall survival of NSCLC patients carrying the respective genetic aberrations. Yet, increasing evidence shows that primary or secondary resistance to ALK-inhibitors during the course of treatment represents a relevant clinical problem. This necessitates a switch to second- or third-generation ALK-TKIs and a close observation of NSCLC patients on ALK-TKIs during the course of treatment by repetitive molecular testing. With this review of the literature, we aim at providing an overview of current knowledge about resistance mechanisms to ALK-TKIs in NSCLC.",

Most NSCLC patients are diagnosed with advanced disease and require systemic treatment. Despite emerging advances in chemotherapy and immunotherapy, the prognosis of stage IV patients remains poor. However, the discovery of oncogenic driver mutations including mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and others, characterize a subset of patients with the opportunity of targeted therapies. Fusions between the ALK and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) are present in \u223c 3-5% of patients with NSCLC. Several first-, second-, and third-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been developed in the last decade and have tremendously changed treatment options and outcomes of ALK-positive NSCLC patients. With increasing treatment options, treatment sequence decisions have become more and more complex. ALK-mutations, fusion variants, or activation of by-pass pathways result in treatment resistance during the course of treatment in nearly all patients. Mutation-guided treatment sequencing can lead to better outcomes, and re-biopsy or liquid-biopsy should be performed whenever possible in case of disease progression in ALK-rearranged patients. In the future, combinational treatment of ALK TKIs with other pathway-inhibitors might further improve patients' treatment options and outcomes. Here, we review the data for currently available ALK TKIs, discuss approaches of treatment sequencing, and give an outlook on emerging developments.",

Crizotinib is a low molecular weight, orally available TKI that inhibits ROS1, MET and ALK and is considered the gold standard first-line treatment with demonstrated significant activity for lung cancers harbouring ROS1 gene rearrangements.

			"abstract": "Since its discovery in 2007, we have seen the lives of patients diagnosed with advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) transform with the advent of molecular therapies with first-, second-, and third-generation ALK inhibitors now available in the clinic. Despite great gains in patient survival now measured in years and preserved quality of life with targeted therapies, drug resistance is unfortunately inevitably encountered in this rare and unique molecular subset of lung cancer, and patients will eventually succumb to the disease. As these patients are often young, fit, and never smokers, the clinical and scientific communities have aligned to expedite drug development and access. Drug resistance profiling and further strategies are being explored through clinical trials, including the evaluation of specific drug sequencing and combinations to overcome such resistance and promote patient longevity. The cases of this report focus on precision medicine and aim to portray the pertinent aspects to consider when treating ALK-rearranged NSCLC in 2020, an ever-shifting space. By way of case examples, this report offers valuable information to the treating clinician, including the evolution of systemic treatments and the management of oligo-progression and multisite drug resistance. With the maturation of real-world data, we are fortunate to be experiencing quality and length of life for patients with this disease surpassing prior expectations in advanced lung cancer. KEY POINTS: This report focuses on the importance of genetic analysis of serial biopsies to capture the dynamic therapeutic vulnerabilities of a patient's tumor, providing a perspective on the complexity of ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ALKi) treatment sequencing. These case examples contribute to the literature on ALK-rearranged and oncogene addicted non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), providing a framework for care in the clinic. In oligo-progressive disease, local ablative therapy and continuation of ALKi postprogression should be considered with potential for sustained disease control. ALK G1202R kinase domain mutations (KDM), highly prevalent at resistance to second-generation ALKi resistances, may emerge in non-EML4-ALK variant 3 cases and is sensitive to third-generation lorlatinib. When in compound with one or more ALK KDMs, resistance to lorlatinib is expected. In the case of rampantly progressive disease, rebiopsy and redefining biology in a timely manner may be informative.",

A few examples of collateral sensitivity have demonstrated that the conformational changes induced by these mutations can create unexpected sensitivity to other kinase inhibitors, but whether this concept can be generalized is unknown. Here is described the development of a model to screen a library of kinase inhibitors for collateral sensitivity drugs active on the Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) protein with the ibrutinib resistance mutation C481S. First, we demonstrate that overexpression of the constitutively active mutant of BTK harboring the E41K mutation in Ba/F3 cells creates an oncogenic addiction to BTK. Then, we have exploited this phenotype to perform a screen of a kinase inhibitor library on cells with or without the ibrutinib resistance mutation. The BTK inhibitors showed the expected sensitivity profile, but none of the drugs tested had a specific activity against the C481S mutant of BTK, suggesting that extending the collateral sensitivity paradigm to all kinases targeted by cancer therapy might not be trivial.",

However, the acquired resistance to these drugs has become an important issue. In this study, we collected a total of 112 serial biopsy samples from 32 patients with ALK-positive lung cancer during multiple ALK-TKI treatments to reveal the resistance mechanisms to ALK-TKI. Among 32 patients, 24\u00a0patients received more than two ALK-TKI. Secondary mutations were observed in 8 of 12 specimens after crizotinib failure (G1202R, G1269A, I1171T, L1196M, C1156Y and F1245V). After alectinib failure, G1202R and I1171N mutations were detected in 7 of 15 specimens. G1202R, F1174V and G1202R, and P-gp overexpression were observed in 3 of 7 samples after ceritinib treatment. L1196M\u00a0+\u00a0G1202R, a compound mutation, was detected in 1 specimen after lorlatinib treatment. ALK-TKI treatment duration was longer in the on-target treatment group than that in the off-target group (13.0 vs 1.2\u00a0months). In conclusion, resistance to ALK-TKI based on secondary mutation in this study was similar to that in previous reports, except for crizotinib resistance.

Limited information is currently available on the mechanisms underlying the initial survival of tumor cells against alectinib. Using patient-derived cell line models, we herein demonstrate that cancer cells survive a treatment with alectinib by activating Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), which mediates the expression of the anti-apoptosis factors Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL, and combinatorial inhibition against both YAP1 and ALK provides a longer tumor remission in ALK-rearranged xenografts when compared with alectinib monotherapy. These results suggest that the inhibition of YAP1 is a candidate for combinatorial therapy with ALK inhibitors to achieve complete remission in patients with ALK-rearranged lung cancer.",

			"abstract": "The biggest hurdle to targeted cancer therapy is the inevitable emergence of drug resistance. Tumor cells employ different mechanisms to resist the targeting agent. Most commonly in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer, secondary resistance mutations on the target kinase domain emerge to diminish the binding affinity of first- and second-generation inhibitors. Other alternative resistance mechanisms include activating complementary bypass pathways and phenotypic transformation. Sequential monotherapies promise to temporarily address the problem of acquired drug resistance, but evidently are limited by the tumor cells' ability to adapt and evolve new resistance mechanisms to persist in the drug environment. Recent studies have nominated a model of drug resistance and tumor progression under targeted therapy as a result of a small subpopulation of cells being able to endure the drug (minimal residual disease cells) and eventually develop further mutations that allow them to regrow and become the dominant population in the therapy-resistant tumor. This subpopulation of cells appears to have developed through a subclonal event, resulting in driver mutations different from the driver mutation that is tumor-initiating in the most common ancestor. As such, an understanding of intratumoral heterogeneity-the driving force behind minimal residual disease-is vital for the identification of resistance drivers that results from branching evolution. Currently available methods allow for a more comprehensive and holistic analysis of tumor heterogeneity in that issues associated with spatial and temporal heterogeneity can now be properly addressed. This review provides some background regarding intratumoral heterogeneity and how it leads to incomplete molecular response to targeted therapies, and proposes the use of single-cell methods, sequential liquid biopsy, and multiregion sequencing to discover the link between intratumoral heterogeneity and early adaptive drug resistance. In summary, minimal residual disease as a result of intratumoral heterogeneity is the earliest form of acquired drug resistance. Emerging technologies such as liquid biopsy and single-cell methods allow for studying targetable drivers of minimal residual disease and contribute to preemptive combinatorial targeting of both drivers of the tumor and its minimal residual disease cells.",

There are currently several ALK inhibitors, including crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, and lorlatinib which have been licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration or the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of ALK+ NSCLC patients. Along with the multiple therapies, the survival of this subtype of NSCLC has been significantly expanded, even for patients whose disease has spread in the brain. Alectinib (Alecensa), a specific ALK and rearranged during transfection tyrosine kinase inhibitor is approved as first-line therapy for metastatic ALK+ NSCLC patients. It is additionally approved for ALK+ NSCLC previously treated with crizotinib. The main aim of this review is to assemble on the efficacy of alectinib for the treatment of ALK+ NSCLC, to elaborate the activity of the drug in the central nervous system, and to debate on which is the position of this compound in the treatment course of ALK+ lung cancer patients.",

The goal of this study is to provide a general estimate of the size and dynamics of a preexisting, drug-resistant tumor cell population versus a slow-growing persister population that is the precursor of acquired TKI resistance. We describe a general model of resistance development, including persister evolution and preexisting resistance, solely based on the macroscopic trajectory of tumor burden during treatment. We applied the model to 20 tumor volume trajectories of EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients treated with the TKI erlotinib. Under the assumption of only preexisting resistant cells or only persister evolution, it is not possible to explain the observed tumor trajectories with realistic parameter values. Assuming only persister evolution would require very high mutation induction rates, while only preexisting resistance would lead to very large preexisting populations of resistant cells at the initiation of treatment. However, combining preexisting resistance with persister populations can explain the observed tumor volume trajectories and yields an estimated preexisting resistant fraction varying from 10",

However, heterogeneous cancer is characterized by diverse molecular alterations as well as multiple clinical profiles. Specific genetic mutations in cancer therapy targets may increase drug sensitivity, or more frequently result in therapeutic resistance. In the past 3 years, several novel targeted therapies have been approved for cancer treatment, including drugs with new targets (i.e., anti-PD1/PDL1 therapies and CDK4/6 inhibitors), mutation targeting drugs (i.e., the EGFR T790M targeting osimertinib), drugs with multiple targets (i.e., the EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor neratinib) and drug combinations (i.e., encorafenib/binimetinib and dabrafenib/trametinib). In this perspective, we focus on the most up-to-date knowledge of targeted therapy and describe how genetic mutations influence the sensitivity of targeted therapy, highlighting the challenges faced within this era of precision medicine. Moreover, the strategies that deal with mutation-driven resistance are further discussed.

			"abstract": "Over the last decade, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), has been identified as a fusion partner in a diverse variety of translocation events resulting in oncogenic signaling in many different cancer types. In tumors where the full-length ALK RTK itself is mutated, such as neuroblastoma, the picture regarding the role of ALK as an oncogenic driver is less clear. Neuroblastoma is a complex and heterogeneous tumor that arises from the neural crest derived peripheral nervous system. Although high-risk neuroblastoma is rare, it often relapses and becomes refractory to treatment. Thus, neuroblastoma accounts for 10-15% of all childhood cancer deaths. Since most cases are in children under the age of 2, understanding the role and regulation of ALK during neural crest development is an important goal in addressing neuroblastoma tumorigenesis. An impressive array of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that act to inhibit ALK have been FDA approved for use in ALK-driven cancers. ALK TKIs bind differently within the ATP-binding pocket of the ALK kinase domain and have been associated with different resistance mutations within ALK itself that arise in response to therapeutic use, particularly in ALK-fusion positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This patient population has highlighted the importance of considering the relevant ALK TKI to be used for a given ALK mutant variant. In this review, we discuss ALK in neuroblastoma, as well as the use of ALK TKIs and other strategies to inhibit tumor growth. Current efforts combining novel approaches and increasing our understanding of the oncogenic role of ALK in neuroblastoma are aimed at improving the efficacy of ALK TKIs as precision medicine options in the clinic.",

Tumors often contain multiple therapeutically relevant alterations, and co-occurring alterations may have a different influence on therapeutic response compared to if those alterations were present alone. One clinically important example of this is the existence of a resistance conferring alteration in combination with a therapeutic sensitizing mutation. The JAX Clinical Knowledgebase (JAX-CKB) (https://ckb.jax.org/) has incorporated the concept of the complex molecular profile, which enables association of therapeutic efficacy data with multiple genomic alterations simultaneously. This provides a mechanism for rapid and accurate assessment of complex cancer-related data, potentially aiding in streamlined clinical decision making. Using the JAX-CKB, we demonstrate the utility of associating data with complex profiles comprising ALK fusions with another variant, which have differing impacts on sensitivity to various ALK inhibitors depending on context.",

However, the activation of mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-Met) has emerged as a common cause of acquired resistance induced by selective ALK inhibitors. Herein, we report the first preclinical characterization of CT-711, a novel dual inhibitor of ALK and c-Met. CT-711 demonstrates potent inhibitory activity against ALK kinase activity. Moreover, CT-711 profoundly inhibits ALK signal transduction and thereby induces G1 phase arrest and apoptosis, and results in remarkable anti-proliferative activity against ALK-driven cancer cells. Furthermore, CT-711 effectively inhibits c-Met kinase activity and potently overcomes the resistance mediated by c-Met activation. When orally administered to nude mice bearing xenografts, CT-711 exhibits favorable pharmacokinetic properties and robust antitumor activity. It is noteworthy that CT-711 is superior to crizotinib, the first-in-class ALK inhibitor, in the treatment of ALK-driven cancers in various models. The results of the current study provide a solid foundation for the clinical investigation of CT-711 in patients with tumors harboring ALK rearrangement.",

Molecular testing at the time of diagnosis guides therapy selection, and targeted therapies in patients with activating mutations in EGFR, BRAF, and rearrangements in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and ROS1 have become part of routine care. These therapies have extended the median survival from a mere few months to greater than 3 years for patients with stage 4 disease. However, despite the initial success, these treatments are eventually met with molecular resistance.

The eventual resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) is monitored clinically and radiologically for prompt molecule shift to further generation TKI, if available. However, the early radiological detection of progression pattern (e.g. nodule onset) should be regarded with caution because overlaps exist with non-tumor cell proliferation and/or accumulation. Here we report the case of a stage IV ALK-rearranged NSCLC patient exposed to serial crizotinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, and lorlatinib (this latter brought to complete brain and leptomeningeal disease response), in a period of more than five years. During lorlatinib, the appearance of solid pulmonary nodules was obviously interpreted as disease progression. However, surgical biopsies of the pulmonary nodules revealed features of sarcoid-like granulomatous lymphadenitis, namely without tumor cell. This invasive approach, besides documenting for the first time a sarcoid-like reaction to ALK inhibitors, allowed to revert the radiological diagnosis and maintain lorlatinib, for the best patient outcome. The pragmatic relevance of these findings suggests a careful attitude towards the interpretation of radiologic patterns of disease progression in patients under TKI.",

However, the effectiveness of molecularly targeted therapies using ALK inhibitors is almost universally limited by drug resistance. Drug resistance to molecularly targeted therapies has now become a major obstacle to effective cancer treatment and personalized medicine. It is of particular importance to provide an improved understanding on the mechanisms of resistance of ALK inhibitors, thus rational new therapeutic strategies can be developed to combat resistance. We used state-of-the-art computational approaches to systematically explore the mutational effects of ALK mutations on drug resistance properties. We found the activation of ALK was increased by substitution with destabilizing mutations, creating the capacity to confer drug resistance to inhibitors. In addition, results implied that evolutionary constraints might affect the drug resistance properties. Moreover, an extensive profile of drugs against ALK mutations was constructed to give better understanding of the mechanism of drug resistance based on structural transitions and energetic variation. Our work hopes to provide an up-to-date mechanistic framework for understanding the mechanisms of drug resistance induced by ALK mutations, thus tailor treatment decisions after the emergence of resistance in ALK-dependent diseases.",

			"abstract": "Lung cancer is treated with many conventional therapies, such as surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. However, these therapies have multiple undesirable side effects. To bypass the side effects elicited by these conventional treatments, molecularly-targeted therapies are currently in use or under development. Current molecularly-targeted therapies effectively target specific biomarkers, which are commonly overexpressed in lung cancers and can cause increased tumorigenicity. Unfortunately, several molecularly-targeted therapies are associated with initial dramatic responses followed by acquired resistance due to spontaneous mutations or activation of signaling pathways. Acquired resistance to molecularly targeted therapies presents a major clinical challenge in the treatment of lung cancer. Therefore, to address this clinical challenge and to improve lung cancer patient prognosis, we need to understand the mechanism of acquired resistance to current therapies and develop additional novel therapies. This review concentrates on various lung cancer biomarkers, including EGFR, ALK, and BRAF, as well as their potential mechanisms of drug resistance.",

			"abstract": "Advances in innovative technology, including next-generation sequencing, have allowed comprehensive genomic analysis and the elucidation of the genomic aspect of intratumor heterogeneity (ITH). Moreover, models of the evolution of the cancer genome have been proposed by integrating these analyses. Cancer has been considered to accumulate genetic abnormalities for clonal evolution in time and space, and these evolutionary patterns vary depending on the organs of primary sites. Selection pressure is an important determinant of such evolutionary patterns. With weak selection pressure, more diverse clones coexist, and heterogeneity increases. Heterogeneity is maximized when there is no selection pressure; in other words, neutral evolution occurs. Some types of cancer such as lung cancer evolve in conditions that have maintained close to neutral evolution and produce diverse variants. This ITH is a key factor contributing to the lethal outcome of cancer, therapeutic failure, and drug resistance. This factor reaffirms the complexity and subtle adaptability of cancer. It is expected that further understanding of ITH and cancer genome evolution will facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies to overcome ITH.",

Computational simulations of protein:drug interactions were used to investigate the impact of seven drug resistant mutations on binding to eleven TKIs approved, or under investigation, for treatment of ALK positive cancers. The results show variant specific disruptions to TKI molecular interactions, and demonstrate the potential to aid prioritization of therapeutic interventions.

In the case of ALK-rearranged gene, subsequent rapid development of effective genotype-directed therapies with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) triggered major advances in the personalized molecularly based approach of NSCLC. Crizotinib was the first-in-class ALK TKI with proven superiority over standard platinum-based chemotherapy for the 1st-line therapy of ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients. However, the acquired resistance to crizotinib and its diminished efficacy to the central nervous system (CNS) relapse led to the development of several novel ALK inhibitors, more potent and with different selectivity compared to crizotinib. To date, four ALK TKIs, crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib and brigatinib have received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and even more agents are currently under investigation for the treatment of ALK-rearranged NSCLC. However, the optimal frontline approach and the exact sequence of ALK inhibitors are still under consideration. Recently announced results of phase III trials recognized higher efficacy of alectinib compared to crizotinib in first-line setting, even in patients with CNS involvement. In this review, we will discuss the current knowledge regarding the biology of the ALK-positive NSCLC, the available therapeutic inhibitors and we will focus on the raised issues from their use in clinical practise.",

			"abstract": "A decade after the discovery of echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) rearrangements in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), several inhibitors have gained regulatory approval, and their sequential use has deferred platinum-based chemotherapy to later lines of therapy. Nevertheless, although most ALK-driven tumors dramatically respond to ALK TKIs , all patients ultimately develop drug-resistant disease. Analysis of post-progression biopsy samples has provided invaluable insight into the mechanisms of resistance, now informing on subsequent therapeutic strategies. In particular, the identification of secondary ALK mutations, which are a common mechanism of resistance to both first-generation and to an even larger extent to second-generation ALK TKIs, may shape a personalized optimal treatment strategy beyond the current first-line choice. Alectinib has now become a preferred treatment option in the first line of therapy, and extrapolation of data obtained from post-progression samples after second-line next-generation ALK TKIs suggests that acquired resistance is likely to be mediated in more than half of patients by ALK resistance mutations. Nevertheless, clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that multiple resistance mechanisms may co-exist at different levels in the same TKI-resistant patient. Newer ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) overcome some resistance mutations through higher exposure and potency, and generally present greater CNS activity, but are unlikely to overcome resistance mediated through separate oncogenic pathway activations, or epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) transformation. Furthermore, while resistance mutations can be detected through commonly available sequencing methods, the identification of other mechanisms of resistance is much less straightforward in the clinic. We hypothesize that the ALK resistance mutation status will likely be crucially important in the choice of second-line therapy after a second-generation TKI. Emerging clinical data also refines the optimal placing of PD-1- and PD-L1-directed immunotherapy in the treatment sequence.",

Two main factors were recently proposed to enhance long-term effectiveness of drug combinations: evolved collateral sensitivities between the drugs in a pair and antagonistic drug interactions. We systematically assessed these factors by performing over 1,600 evolution experiments with the opportunistic nosocomial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa in single- and multidrug environments. Based on the growth dynamics during these experiments, we reconstructed antibiotic combination efficacy (ACE) networks as a new tool for characterizing the ability of the tested drug combinations to constrain bacterial survival as well as drug resistance evolution across time. Subsequent statistical analysis of the influence of the factors on ACE network characteristics revealed that (i) synergistic drug interactions increased the likelihood of bacterial population extinction-irrespective of whether combinations were compared at the same level of inhibition or not-while (ii) the potential for evolved collateral sensitivities between 2 drugs accounted for a reduction in bacterial adaptation rates. In sum, our systematic experimental analysis allowed us to pinpoint 2 complementary determinants of combination efficacy and to identify specific drug pairs with high ACE scores. Our findings can guide attempts to further improve the sustainability of antibiotic therapy by simultaneously reducing pathogen load and resistance evolution.",

The development of ALK inhibitors following the identification of the EML4-ALK fusion gene in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) has opened new possibilities for ALK-positive ALCL. The uniform expression of CD30 on the cell surface of ALCL has given the opportunity for anti-CD30 antibody therapy. The re-evaluation of vinblastine, which has shown remarkable activity as a single agent even in the face of relapsed disease, has led to the consideration of a revised approach to frontline therapy. The advent of immune therapies such as checkpoint inhibition has provided another option for the treatment of ALCL. In fact, the number of potential new agents now presents a real challenge to the clinical community that must prioritise those thought to offer the most promise for the future. In this review, we will focus on the current status of paediatric ALCL therapy, explore how new and 'renewed' agents are re-shaping the therapeutic landscape for ALCL, and identify the strategies being employed in the next generation of clinical trials.",

			"abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of death by cancer in North America. A decade ago, genomic rearrangements in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) receptor tyrosine kinase were identified in a subset of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients. Soon after, crizotinib, a small molecule ATP-competitive ALK inhibitor was proven to be more effective than chemotherapy in ALK-positive NSCLC patients. Crizotinib and two other ATP-competitive ALK inhibitors, ceritinib and alectinib, are approved for use as a first-line therapy in these patients, where ALK rearrangement is currently diagnosed by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. The clinical success of these three ALK inhibitors has led to the development of next-generation ALK inhibitors with even greater potency and selectivity. However, patients inevitably develop resistance to ALK inhibitors leading to tumor relapse that commonly manifests in the form of brain metastasis. Several new approaches aim to overcome the various mechanisms of resistance that develop in ALK-positive NSCLC including the knowledge-based alternate and successive use of different ALK inhibitors, as well as combined therapies targeting ALK plus alternative signaling pathways. Key issues to resolve for the optimal implementation of established and emerging treatment modalities for ALK-rearranged NSCLC therapy include the high cost of the targeted inhibitors and the potential of exacerbated toxicities with combination therapies.",

ALK is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that, upon ligand binding to its extracellular domain, undergoes dimerization and subsequent autophosphorylation of the intracellular kinase domain. When activated in cancer it represents a target for specific inhibitors, such as crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib etc. which use has demonstrated significant effectiveness in ALK-positive patients, in particular ALK-positive non- small cell lung cancer.

			"abstract": "The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, and many kinds of ALK fusion genes have been found in a variety of carcinomas. There is almost no detectable expression of ALK in adults. However, through ALK gene rearrangement, the resultant ALK fusion protein is aberrantly overexpressed and dimerized through the oligomerization domains, such as the coiled-coil domain, in the fusion partner that induces abnormal constitutive activation of ALK tyrosine kinase. This results in dysregulated cell proliferation. ALK gene rearrangement has been observed in 3%-5% of non-small-cell lung cancers, and multiple ALK inhibitors have been developed for the treatment of ALK-positive lung cancer. Among those inhibitors, in Japan, 3 (4 in the USA) ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been approved and are currently used in clinics. All of the currently approved ALK-TKIs have been shown to induce marked tumor regression in ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer; however, tumors inevitably relapse because of acquired resistance within a few years. This review focuses on ALK-TKIs, their resistance mechanisms, and the potential therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance.",

			"abstract": "Personalized targeted therapy has emerged as a promising strategy in lung cancer treatment, with current attention focused on elucidation and detection of oncogenic drivers responsible for tumor initiation and maintenance and development of drug resistance. In lung cancer, several oncogenic drivers have been reported, triggering the application of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to target these dysfunctional genes. The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement is responsible for about 4-7% of all non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) and perhaps as high as a third in specific patient populations such as younger, male, non-smokers with advanced stage, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS) wild type, and signet ring cell adenocarcinoma with abundant intracytoplasmic mucin. The selection of patients based on their ALK status is vital on account of the high response rates with the ALK-targeted agents in this subset of patients. Standardization and validation of ALK rearrangement detection methods is essential for accurate and reproducible results. There are currently three detection methods widely available in clinical practice, including fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based next generation sequencing (NGS) technology. However, the choice of diagnostic methodology for ALK rearrangement detection in clinical practice remains a matter of debate. With accumulating data enumerating the advantages and disadvantages of each of the three methods, combining more than one testing method for ALK fusion detection may be beneficial for patients. In this review, we will discuss the current methods used in ALK rearrangement detection with emphasis on their key advantages and disadvantages.",

However, clinical resistance to ALK inhibitors invariably occurs, and the molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood.

The precise junctions of EML4-ALK, CCDC6-RET and five other gene fusions were also detected. Taking advantages of long-read sequencing, we conducted phasing of EGFR mutations and elucidated the mutational allelic backgrounds of anti-tumor drug-sensitive and resistant mutations, which could provide useful information for selecting therapeutic approaches. In the H1975 cells, 72% of the reads harbored both L858R and T790M mutations, and 22% of the reads harbored neither mutation. To ensure that the clinical requirements can be met in potentially low cancer cell populations, we further conducted a serial dilution analysis of the template for EGFR mutations. Several percent of the mutant alleles could be detected depending on the yield and quality of the sequencing data. Finally, we characterized the mutation genotypes in eight clinical samples. This method could be a convenient long-read sequencing-based analytical approach and thus may change the current approaches used for cancer genome sequencing.",

As a result of this heterogeneity, the bulk tumour might include a diverse collection of cells harbouring distinct molecular signatures with differential levels of sensitivity to treatment. This heterogeneity might result in a non-uniform distribution of genetically distinct tumour-cell subpopulations across and within disease sites (spatial heterogeneity) or temporal variations in the molecular makeup of cancer cells (temporal heterogeneity). Heterogeneity provides the fuel for resistance; therefore, an accurate assessment of tumour heterogeneity is essential for the development of effective therapies. Multiregion sequencing, single-cell sequencing, analysis of autopsy samples, and longitudinal analysis of liquid biopsy samples are all emerging technologies with considerable potential to dissect the complex clonal architecture of cancers. In this Review, we discuss the driving forces behind intratumoural heterogeneity and the current approaches used to combat this heterogeneity and its consequences.

			"abstract": "Metastatic breast cancer remains challenging to treat, and most patients ultimately progress on therapy. This acquired drug resistance is largely due to drug-refractory sub-populations (subclones) within heterogeneous tumors. Here, we track the genetic and phenotypic subclonal evolution of four breast cancers through years of treatment to better understand how breast cancers become drug-resistant. Recurrently appearing post-chemotherapy mutations are rare. However, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing reveal acquisition of malignant phenotypes after treatment, including enhanced mesenchymal and growth factor signaling, which may promote drug resistance, and decreased antigen presentation and TNF-\u03b1 signaling, which may enable immune system avoidance. Some of these phenotypes pre-exist in pre-treatment subclones that become dominant after chemotherapy, indicating selection for resistance phenotypes. Post-chemotherapy cancer cells are effectively treated with drugs targeting acquired phenotypes. These findings highlight cancer's ability to evolve phenotypically and suggest a phenotype-targeted treatment strategy that adapts to cancer as it evolves.",

Identifying actionable genomic alterations is the initial step towards precision medicine. An important scientific progress in molecular profiling of NSCLC over the past decade is the shift from the traditional piecemeal fashion to massively parallel sequencing with the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS). Another technical advance is the development of liquid biopsy with great potential in providing a dynamic and comprehensive genomic profiling of NSCLC in a minimally invasive manner. The integration of NGS with liquid biopsy has been demonstrated to play emerging roles in genomic profiling of NSCLC by increasing evidences. This review summarized the potential applications of NGS-based liquid biopsy in the diagnosis and treatment of NSCLC including identifying actionable genomic alterations, tracking spatiotemporal tumor evolution, dynamically monitoring response and resistance to targeted therapies, and diagnostic value in early-stage NSCLC, and discussed emerging challenges to overcome in order to facilitate clinical translation in future.",

The clinically approved first-line treatment crizotinib specifically inhibits ALK and improves progression-free survival (PFS) in treated and untreated patients by 4 months compared to standard chemotherapy. While some patients relapse after crizotinib treatment due to resistance mutations in ALK, second-generation ALK inhibitors effectively induce tumor response and prolong PFS. Alectinib, a second-generation ALK inhibitor, has recently been approved for ALK-rearranged NSCLC after patients progressed on crizotinib. Alectinib is able to inhibit several crizotinib- and ceritinib-resistant ALK mutations in vitro. Furthermore, alectinib is a more potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), with favorable safety profile, and has increased penetration into the central nervous system, inhibiting crizotinib-resistant brain metastases. The discovery of effective personalized therapies to combat ALK-rearranged NSCLC such as alectinib is an example of the importance of genomic profiling of NSCLC and provides an excellent template for future discoveries in managing these tumors.",

Given the high risks and costs associated with repeat physical biopsy, alternative technologies must be applied. Several modalities exist for analysis and re-analysis of cancer biology. Among them are the CellSearch platform, the CTC chip, and the high-definition CTC platform. While the former is primarily able to provide prognosticating information in the form of CTC enumeration, the latter two have the advantage of serving as a platform to study tumor biology. Techniques for analysis of single cell genomics, as well as protein expression on a single cell basis provide scientists with the capacity to understand cancer cell populations as a collection of individual cells, rather than as an average of all cells. A multimodal combination of circulating tumor DNAs (ctDNAs), CTCs, proteomics, and CTC-derived xenografts (CDXs) to create computational models useful in diagnosis, prognostication, and predictiveness to treatment is likely the future of tailoring individualized cancer care.",

The identification of certain activating fusions can aid in the diagnosis and effective treatment of patients with tumours harbouring these alterations. Advances in the techniques used to identify fusions have enabled physicians to detect these alterations in the clinic. Targeted therapies directed at constitutively activated oncogenic tyrosine kinases have proven remarkably effective against cancers with fusions involving ALK, ROS1, or PDGFB, and the efficacy of this approach continues to be explored in malignancies with RET, NTRK1/2/3, FGFR1/2/3, and BRAF/CRAF fusions. Nevertheless, prolonged treatment with such tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) leads to the development of acquired resistance to therapy. This resistance can be mediated by mutations that alter drug binding, or by the activation of bypass pathways. Second-generation and third-generation TKIs have been developed to overcome resistance, and have variable levels of activity against tumours harbouring individual mutations that confer resistance to first-generation TKIs. The rational sequential administration of different inhibitors is emerging as a new treatment paradigm for patients with tumours that retain continued dependency on the downstream kinase of interest.",

			"abstract": "Tumorigenic rearrangements in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) account for 3-7% of all non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Treatment with targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has shown impressive clinical responses. Crizotinib was the first agent approved for front-line therapy of ALK-rearranged NSCLC after it demonstrated superiority to chemotherapy in response rate, duration of response, and progression-free survival. However, eventually all patients progress on crizotinib therapy, with the central nervous system (CNS) being the most common site, which served as the impetus for the development of more potent next-generation ALK inhibitors. Currently, ceritinib, alectinib, and brigatinib are all approved for second-line therapy after progression on or intolerance to crizotinib. Investigations into whether the initiation of a second-generation ALK inhibitor as first-line therapy is the superior treatment paradigm has resulted in the approval of ceritinib as initial therapy. Alectinib has also shown impressive results as front-line therapy, as recently reported in two large randomized studies that compared it to crizotinib. There is a significant need to better understand the drivers of and mechanisms underlying resistance to ALK inhibitors. While specific mutations have been identified, there is currently only limited evidence that the identification of specific mutations should impact selection of the next ALK inhibitor. The best treatment option for patients who become TKI refractory is also unclear, though there is some evidence to suggests that these patients are not responsive to checkpoint inhibitors and may respond better to chemotherapy. Combination therapy with other classes of agents may help to overcome resistance mechanisms and should be investigated further.",

Using bronchoscopically biopsied and surgically resected specimens, we performed targeted sequencing of 53 lung cancer-related genes and compared the tumor mutation profiles before and after SRT. Identical mutations were detected from tumor specimens collected before and after SRT, and the specimens were confirmed to be clonal.

			"abstract": "The receptor tyrosine kinase family consisting of Tyro3, Axl, and Mer (TAM) is one of the most recently identified receptor tyrosine kinase families. TAM receptors are up-regulated postnatally and maintained at high levels in adults. They all play an important role in immunity, but Axl has also been implicated in cancer and therefore is a target in the discovery and development of novel therapeutics. However, of the three members of the TAM family, the Axl kinase domain is the only one that has so far eluded structure determination. To this end, using differential scanning fluorimetry and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we show here that a lower stability and greater dynamic nature of the Axl kinase domain may account for its poor crystallizability. We present the first structural characterization of the Axl kinase domain in complex with a small-molecule macrocyclic inhibitor. The Axl crystal structure revealed two distinct conformational states of the enzyme, providing a first glimpse of what an active TAM receptor kinase may look like and suggesting a potential role for the juxtamembrane region in enzyme activity. We noted that the ATP/inhibitor-binding sites of the TAM members closely resemble each other, posing a challenge for the design of a selective inhibitor. We propose that the differences in the conformational dynamics among the TAM family members could potentially be exploited to achieve inhibitor selectivity for targeted receptors.",

			"abstract": "Drug resistance remains an elusive problem in cancer therapy, particularly for novel targeted therapies. Much work is focused upon the development of an arsenal of targeted therapies, towards oncogenic driver genes such as ALK-EML4, to overcome the inevitable resistance that develops over time. Currently, after failure of first line ALK TKI therapy, another ALK TKI is administered, though collateral sensitivity is not considered. To address this, we evolved resistance in an ALK rearranged non-small cell lung cancer line (H3122) to a panel of 4 ALK TKIs, and performed a collateral sensitivity analysis. All ALK inhibitor resistant cell lines displayed significant cross-resistance to all other ALK inhibitors. We then evaluated ALK-inhibitor sensitivities after drug holidays of varying length (1-21\u2009days), and observed dynamic patterns of resistance. This unpredictability led us to an expanded search for treatment options, where we tested 6 further anti-cancer agents for collateral sensitivity among resistant cells, uncovering possibilities for further treatment, including cross-sensitivity to standard cytotoxic therapies, as well as Hsp90 inhibitors. Taken together, these results imply that resistance to targeted therapy in non-small cell lung cancer is highly dynamic, and also one where there are many opportunities to re-establish sensitivities where there was once resistance. Drug resistance in cancer inevitably emerges during treatment; particularly with novel targeted therapies, designed to inhibit specific molecules. A clinically-relevant example of this phenomenon occurs in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer, where targeted therapies are used to inhibit the ALK-EML4 fusion protein. A potential solution to this may lie in finding drug sensitivities in the resistant population, termed collateral sensitivities, and then using these as second-line agents. This study shows how the evolution of resistance in ALK-positive lung cancer is a dynamic process through time, one in which patterns of drug resistance and collateral sensitivity change substantially, and therefore one where temporal regimens, such as drug cycling and drug holidays may have great benefit.",

One potential strategy proposed to overcome acquired resistance involves taking repeat tumor biopsies at the time of disease progression, to identify the specific molecular mechanism driving resistance in an individual patient and to select a new agent or combination of agents capable of surmounting that specific resistance mechanism. However, recent studies sampling multiple metastatic lesions upon acquired resistance, or employing \"liquid biopsy\" analyses of circulating tumor DNA, have revealed that multiple, heterogeneous resistance mechanisms can emerge in distinct tumor subclones in the same patient. This heterogeneity represents a major clinical challenge for devising therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance. In many cancers, multiple drug resistance mechanisms often converge to reactivate the original pathway targeted by the drug. This convergent evolution creates an opportunity to target a common signaling node to overcome resistance. Furthermore, integration of liquid biopsy approaches into clinical practice may allow real-time monitoring of emerging resistance alterations, allowing intervention prior to standard detection of radiographic progression. In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding tumor heterogeneity and resistance to targeted therapies, focusing on combination kinase inhibitors, and we discuss approaches to address these issues in the clinic.",

			"abstract": "In this study, we investigated the role of C3orf21 gene polymorphism at the rs2131877 locus and its contribution to lung adenocarcinoma pathogenesis. Normal lung and tumor tissue sections were collected from fifteen patients with lung adenocarcinoma for chromosome 3 open reading frame 21 (C3orf21) genotype analysis. In addition, a retrospective analysis was performed to assess the association between C3orf21 genotype and tumor markers from patient samples used in our previously published study. In parallel, we also manipulated C3orf21 gene expression either by overexpressing or ablating it in a MSTO-211H human lung cancer cell line to further understand its contribution to cell proliferation, apoptosis and migration. Our results indicated that the patients with smoking history had a significantly increased mutation (rs2131877 T/C+C/C genotype) rate (p = 0.025), in addition to higher values for the CYF211 and NSE tumor markers (p = 0.014 and p = 0.031, respectively). The retrospective analysis also confirmed that the NSE marker value was higher in patients with a C3orf21 rs2131877 T/C+C/C genotype. Furthermore, our in vitro data indicated that C3orf21 ablation promoted lung cancer cell proliferation, inhibited apoptosis and accelerated cell migration. Overall, our study concluded that C30rf21 rs 2131877 T/C+C/C genotype patients may experience increased nicotine addiction and that C30rf21 can likely serve as a susceptibility marker for lung adenocarcinoma with a higher degree of malignancy.",

How, therefore, do cancers evolve under the selective pressures of cancer therapy? Recent studies have linked both primary (or de novo) and acquired treatment resistance to intratumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution. Resistance to targeted therapies often includes mutation of the drug target itself and aberrations of pathways upstream of, downstream from, or parallel to the drug target. For systemic chemotherapies, discrete and recurrent resistance-conferring genetic aberrations have eluded the community, due in part to their wide-ranging mutagenic effects. In this review, we discuss different patterns of clonal evolution during treatment-specific selective pressures and focus on the genetic mechanisms of treatment resistance that have emerged to both targeted therapies and chemotherapies.",

It is of great importance to understand how this extremely rare event occurred for the purpose of overcoming the acquired resistance of such inhibitors. In this study, we exploited molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to dissect the molecular mechanisms. Our MD results revealed that L1198F mutation of ALK resulted in the conformational change at the inhibitor site and altered the binding affinity of ALK to crizotinib and lorlatinib. L1198F mutation also affected the autoactivation of ALK as supported by the identification of His1124 and Tyr1278 as critical amino acids involved in ATP binding and phosphorylation. Our findings are valuable for designing more specific and potent inhibitors for the treatment of ALK-positive NSCLC and other types of cancer.",

ALK-L1198F and ALK-G1201E mutations were originally identified in anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) and characterized as constitutively activating mutations. In this study, we employed in vitro cell culture assays together with biochemical and in vivo Drosophila analyses to characterize their sensitivity to either activation by the FAM150A (AUG-\u03b2) and FAM150B (AUG-\u03b1) ALK ligands or inhibition by ALK inhibitors. Here we report that neither ALK-L1198F nor ALK-G1201E mutations result in ligand independent gain-of-function (GOF) activity in either in vitro biochemical analysis or the various model systems employed. ALK-L1198F is activated by the FAM150 (AUG) ligands and its ligand-dependant activity is similar to the wild type full length ALK receptor. ALK-G1201E is only very weakly activated by the FAM150 (AUG) ligands, most likely due to impaired protein stability. We conclude that neither ALK-L1198F nor ALK-G1201E displays ligand independent kinase activity, with ALK-L1198F belonging to the class of ligand dependent ALK mutations which are not constitutively active but that responds to ligand activation, while the ALK-G1201E mutation generates an unstable receptor with very low levels of kinase activity.",

Alectinib is a second-generation ALK inhibitor capable of overcoming multiple crizotinib-resistant ALK mutations and has demonstrated improved outcomes after crizotinib failure.

Crizotinib blocks ALK-triggered pathways such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR, indispensable for survival of ALK-driven tumors.Despite the positive impact of targeted treatment in ALCL, resistant clones are often selected during therapy. Strategies to overcome resistance include the design of second generation drugs and the use of combined therapies that simultaneously target multiple nodes essential for cells survival. We investigated the effects of combined ALK/mTOR inhibition. We observed a specific synergistic effect of combining ALK inhibitors with an mTOR inhibitor (temsirolimus), in ALK+ lymphoma cells. The positive cooperation resulted in an increased inhibition of mTOR effectors, compared to single treatments, a block in G0/G1 phase and induction of apoptosis. The combination was able to prevent the selection of resistant clones, while long-term exposure to single agents led to the establishment of resistant cell lines, with either ALK inhibitor or temsirolimus. In vivo, mice injected with Karpas 299 cells and treated with low dose combination showed complete regression of tumors, while only partial inhibition was obtained in single agents-treated mice. Upon treatment stop the combination was able to significantly delay tumor relapses. Re-challenge of relapsed tumors at a higher dose led to full regression of xenografts in the combination group, but not in mice treated with lorlatinib alone. In conclusion, our data suggest that the combination of ALK and mTOR inhibitors could be a valuable therapeutic option for ALK+ ALCL patients.",

This reveals a role for pharmacogenomic analysis to identify and monitor for resistance, with possible therapeutic strategies to combat chemoresistance.",

ALK rearrangements are detected in 3%-7% of patients with NSCLC and are particularly enriched in younger patients with adenocarcinoma and a never or light smoking history. Fortuitously, crizotinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor initially developed to target cMET, was able to be repurposed for ALK-rearranged (ALK+) NSCLC. Despite dramatic and durable initial responses to crizotinib; however, the vast majority of patients will develop resistance within a few years. Diverse molecular mechanisms underlie resistance to crizotinib. This review will describe the clinical activity of crizotinib, review identified mechanisms of crizotinib resistance, and end with a survey of emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at overcoming crizotinib resistance.",

However, neither PCR-based assays nor amplicon-based targeted sequencing can detect fusion genes like anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements in blood samples. To investigate the feasibility and performance of capture-based sequencing on ALK fusion detection, we developed a capture-based targeted sequencing panel to detect and quantify rearrangement events, along with other driver mutation variants in plasma. In this perspective study, we screened 364 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for ALK rearrangements, and collected blood samples from 24 of them with confirmed ALK rearrangements based on their tissue biopsies. ALK rearrangements were successfully detected in 19 of 24 patients at baseline with 79.2% (95% CI 57.9%, 92.9%) sensitivity and 100% (36/36) specificity. Among the 24 patients, we obtained longitudinal blood samples from 7 of them after either chemotherapy and/or Crizotinib treatment for disease monitoring. The by-sample detection rate of ALK rearrangements after treatment drops to 69.2% (9 of 13). In addition to detecting ALK rearrangements, we also detected 3 Crizotinib resistant mutations, ALK L1152R, ALK I1171T and ALK L1196M from patient P4. ctDNA concentration correlates with responses and disease progression, reflecting its ability as a biomarker. Our findings suggest capture-based sequencing can detect and quantify ALK rearrangements as well as other somatic mutations, including mutations mediated drug resistance, in plasma with high sensitivity, paving the way for its application in identifying driver fusion genes and monitoring tumor dynamics in the clinic.",

Chemotherapy remains the gold standard in nearly 80% of lung cancers, but clinical outcomes are discouraging, and the impact on median overall survival (OS) barely reaches 12 months. At the end of the last century, the discovery of oncogene-driven tumours completely changed the therapeutic landscape in lung cancers, harbouring specific gene mutations/translocations. Epidermal growth factors receptor (EGFR) common mutations first and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocations later led new insights in lung cancer biology knowledge. The use of specific tyrosine kinases inhibitors overturned the biological behaviour of EGFR mutation positive tumours and became a preclinical model to understand the heterogeneity of lung cancers and the mechanisms of drug resistance.

			"abstract": "Crizotinib is an oral inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) with remarkable clinical activity in patients suffering from ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), accounting to its superiority compared to chemotherapy. Unfortunately, virtually all ALK-rearranged tumors acquire resistance to crizotinib, frequently within one year since the treatment initiation. To date, therapeutic strategies to overcome crizotinib resistance have focused on the use of more potent and structurally different compounds. Second-generation ALK inhibitors such as ceritinib (LDK378), alectinib (CH5424802/RO5424802) and brigatinib (AP26113) have shown relevant clinical activity, consequently fostering their rapid clinical development and their approval by health agencies. The third-generation inhibitor lorlatinib (PF-06463922), selectively active against ALK and ROS1, harbors impressive biological potency; its efficacy in reversing resistance to crizotinib and to other ALK inhibitors is being proven by early clinical trials. The NTRK1-3 and ROS1 inhibitor entrectinib (RXDX-101) has been reported to act against NSCLC harboring ALK fusion proteins too. Despite the quick development of these novel agents, several issues remain to be discussed in the treatment of patients suffering from ALK-rearranged NSCLC. This position paper will discuss the development, the current evidence and approvals, as long as the future perspectives of new ALK inhibitors beyond crizotinib. Clinical behaviors of ALK-rearranged NSCLC vary significantly among patients and differential molecular events responsible of crizotinib resistance account for the most important quote of this heterogeneity. The precious availability of a wide range of active anti-ALK compounds should be approached in a critical and careful perspective, in order to develop treatment strategies tailored on the disease evolution of every single patient.",

In this study we aimed to identify fusion genes in crizotinib resistant tumor samples. Re-biopsies of three patients were subjected to paired-end RNA sequencing to identify fusion genes using deFuse and EricScript. The IGV browser was used to determine presence of known resistance-associated mutations. Sanger sequencing was used to validate fusion genes and digital droplet PCR to validate mutations. ALK fusion genes were detected in all three patients with EML4 being the fusion partner. One patient had no additional fusion genes. Another patient had one additional fusion gene, but without a predicted open reading frame (ORF). The third patient had three additional fusion genes, of which two were derived from the same chromosomal region as the EML4-ALK. A predicted ORF was identified only in the CLIP4-VSNL1 fusion product. The fusion genes validated in the post-treatment sample were also present in the biopsy before crizotinib. ALK mutations (p.C1156Y and p.G1269A) detected in the re-biopsies of two patients, were not detected in pre-treatment biopsies. In conclusion, fusion genes identified in our study are unlikely to be involved in crizotinib resistance based on presence in pre-treatment biopsies. The detection of ALK mutations in post-treatment tumor samples of two patients underlines their role in crizotinib resistance.",

Here we assess the impact of several kinase-domain mutations that arose during TKI resistance selections of ALK+ anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) cell lines. These include novel variants with respect to ALK-fusion cancers, R1192P and T1151M, and with respect to ALCL, F1174L and I1171S. We assess the effects of these mutations on the activity of six clinical inhibitors in independent systems engineered to depend on either the ALCL fusion kinase NPM-ALK or the lung-cancer fusion kinase EML4-ALK. Our results inform treatment strategies with a likelihood of bypassing mutations when detected in resistant patient samples and highlight differences between the effects of particular mutations on the two ALK fusions.",

			"abstract": "In the evolution of species, the karyotype changes with a timescale of tens to hundreds of thousand years. In the development of cancer, the karyotype often is modified in cancerous cells over the lifetime of an individual. Characterizing these changes and understanding the mechanisms leading to them has been of interest in a broad range of disciplines including evolution, cytogenetics, and cancer genetics. A central issue relates to the relative roles of random vs deterministic mechanisms in shaping the changes. Although it is possible that all changes result from random events followed by selection, many results point to other non-random factors that play a role in karyotype evolution. In cancer, chromosomal instability leads to characteristic changes in the karyotype, in which different individuals with a specific type of cancer display similar changes in karyotype structure over time. Statistical analyses of chromosome lengths in different species indicate that the length distribution of chromosomes is not consistent with models in which the lengths of chromosomes are random or evolve solely by simple random processes. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying karyotype evolution should enable the development of quantitative theoretical models that combine the random and deterministic processes that can be compared to experimental determinations of the karyotype in diverse settings.",

Furthermore, a growing body of evidence suggests that tumor development could be hampered by the accumulation of slightly deleterious passenger mutations. In this work, we combined empirical epistasis networks, computer simulations, and mathematical models to explore how synergistic interactions among driver mutations affect cancer progression under the burden of slightly deleterious passengers. We found that epistasis plays a crucial role in tumor development by promoting the transformation of precancerous clones into rapidly growing tumors through a process that is analogous to evolutionary rescue. The triggering of epistasis-driven rescue is strongly dependent on the intensity of epistasis and could be a key rate-limiting step in many tumors, contributing to their unpredictability. As a result, central genes in cancer epistasis networks appear as key intervention targets for cancer therapy.",

In this study, we employed 2-photon laser scanning microscopy (2PLSM) to visualise the intrinsic second-harmonic generation (SHG) signal emitted by collagen fibres in the heterogeneous ECM of human colon tumour tissues. Through texture analysis of the SHG signal, we quantitatively distinguished the imaging features generated by structural differences of collagen fibres in healthy colon and cancers and found marked differences. The fibres inside of tumours exhibited a loss of organisation, particularly pronounced in right-sided colon cancer (RSCC), where the chaotic regions were significantly increased. In addition, a higher collagen content was found in left-sided colon cancer (LSCC). In future, this might aid in subclassification and therapeutic decisions or even in designing new therapy regimens by taking into account the differences between collagen fibres features between colon tumours located at different sides.",

			"abstract": "Resistance of cancers to treatments, such as chemotherapy, largely arise due to cell mutations. These mutations allow cells to resist apoptosis and inevitably lead to recurrence and often progression to more aggressive cancer forms. Sustained-low dose therapies are being considered as an alternative over maximum tolerated dose treatments, whereby a smaller drug dosage is given over a longer period of time. However, understanding the impact that the presence of treatment-resistant clones may have on these new treatment modalities is crucial to validating them as a therapeutic avenue. In this study, a Moran process is used to capture stochastic mutations arising in cancer cells, inferring treatment resistance. The model is used to predict the probability of cancer recurrence given varying treatment modalities. The simulations predict that sustained-low dose therapies would be virtually ineffective for a cancer with a non-negligible probability of developing a sub-clone with resistance tendencies. Furthermore, calibrating the model to in vivo measurements for breast cancer treatment with Herceptin, the model suggests that standard treatment regimens are ineffective in this mouse model. Using a simple Moran model, it is possible to explore the likelihood of treatment success given a non-negligible probability of treatment resistant mutations and suggest more robust therapeutic schedules.",

			"abstract": "Complex chromosome rearrangements, known as chromoanagenesis, are widespread in cancer. Based on large-scale DNA sequencing of human tumours, the most frequent type of complex chromosome rearrangement is chromothripsis, a massive, localized and clustered rearrangement of one (or a few) chromosomes seemingly acquired in a single event. Chromothripsis can be initiated by mitotic errors that produce a micronucleus encapsulating a single chromosome or chromosomal fragment. Rupture of the unstable micronuclear envelope exposes its chromatin to cytosolic nucleases and induces chromothriptic shattering. Found in up to half of tumours included in pan-cancer genomic analyses, chromothriptic rearrangements can contribute to tumorigenesis through inactivation of tumour suppressor genes, activation of proto-oncogenes, or gene amplification through the production of self-propagating extrachromosomal circular DNAs encoding oncogenes or genes conferring anticancer drug resistance. Here, we discuss what has been learned about the mechanisms that enable these complex genomic rearrangements and their consequences in cancer.",

This shift leads to a breakdown in the crucial regulators inherent to multicellularity, resulting in the emergence of diverse cancer cell subpopulations that have enhanced adaptability. The presence of different cell subpopulations within a tumour, known as intratumoural heterogeneity (ITH), poses challenges for cancer treatment. In this review, we delve into the dynamics of the shift from multicellularity to unicellularity during cancer onset and progression. We highlight the role of genetic and non-genetic factors, as well as tumour microenvironment, in promoting ITH and cancer evolution. Additionally, we shed light on the latest advancements in omics technologies that allow for in-depth analysis of tumours at the single-cell level and their spatial organization within the tissue.

Here we report predictive modelling of neoadjuvant therapy response using clinicopathological and genomic features of pre-treatment tumour biopsies identified age, estrogen receptor (ER) status and level of immune cell infiltration may together be important for predicting response. Clonal evolution analysis of longitudinally collected tumour samples show subclonal diversity and dynamics are evident with potential therapy resistant subclones detected. The sources of greater pre-treatment immunogenicity associated with a pathological complete response is largely unexplored in HER2+ tumours.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the predominant pathological type of lung cancer with a high mortality rate. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a N6 methylation regulator-related gene signature for assessing prognosis and response to immunotherapy in NSCLC. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas was used as the training cohort. Data from Gene Expression Omnibus and Xena served as the two validation cohorts. We performed Cox regression, last absolute shrinkage and selection operator, receiver operating characteristic curves and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to generate and validate a prognostic signature based on m6A regulator-related genes. We explored the association between the signature and tumor microenvironment including genomic mutation, immune cell infiltration and tumor mutation burden. We also analyzed the association between the signature and immunotherapy. Finally, among the genes that constituted the signature, GGA2 was the only favorable factor for NSCLC prognosis. Molecular experiments were used to explore GGA2 function in NSCLC. We generated a prognostic signature based on seven m6A regulator-related genes (GGA2, CD70, BMP2, GPX8, YWHAZ, NOG and TEAD4). And the data from three cohorts showed that the signature could effectively assess prognosis in NSCLC. Patients with high risk scores had the higher mutational load and lower immune infiltration levels and were more likely to not respond to immunotherapy. The experiments revealed overexpression of GGA2 inhibited proliferation and motility of NSCLC cells. Mechanically, GGA2 downregulated METTL3 expression and thus reduced m6A abundance in NSCLC. This study developed and validated a prognostic signature based on m6A regulator-related genes, providing useful insights for the management of NSCLC. And GGA2 may be a target of m6A regulation.",

Effective simple mathematical laws have been shown to describe tumor growth in vitro, or simple animal models with bounded-growth dynamics accurately. However, results for the growth of human cancers in patients are scarce. Our study mined a large dataset of 1133 brain metastases (BMs) with longitudinal imaging follow-up to find growth laws for untreated BMs and recurrent treated BMs. Untreated BMs showed high growth exponents, most likely related to the underlying evolutionary dynamics, with experimental tumors in mice resembling accurately the disease. Recurrent BMs growth exponents were smaller, most probably due to a reduction in tumor heterogeneity after treatment, which may limit the tumor evolutionary capabilities. In silico simulations using a stochastic discrete mesoscopic model with basic evolutionary dynamics led to results in line with the observed data.",

			"abstract": "Cancer results from an evolutionary process that typically yields multiple clones with varying sets of mutations within the same tumor. Accurately modeling this process is key to understanding and predicting cancer evolution. Here, we introduce clone to mutation (CloMu), a flexible and low-parameter tree generative model of cancer evolution. CloMu uses a two-layer neural network trained via reinforcement learning to determine the probability of new mutations based on the existing mutations on a clone. CloMu supports several prediction tasks, including the determination of evolutionary trajectories, tree selection, causality and interchangeability between mutations, and mutation fitness. Importantly, previous methods support only some of these tasks, and many suffer from overfitting on data sets with a large number of mutations. Using simulations, we show that CloMu either matches or outperforms current methods on a wide variety of prediction tasks. In particular, for simulated data with interchangeable mutations, current methods are unable to uncover causal relationships as effectively as CloMu. On breast cancer and leukemia cohorts, we show that CloMu determines similarities and causal relationships between mutations as well as the fitness of mutations. We validate CloMu's inferred mutation fitness values for the leukemia cohort by comparing them to clonal proportion data not used during training, showing high concordance. In summary, CloMu's low-parameter model facilitates a wide range of prediction tasks regarding cancer evolution on increasingly available cohort-level data sets.",

			"abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are linked to cancer via pathogenic changes in their expression levels. Yet, it remains unclear whether lncRNAs can also impact tumour cell fitness via function-altering somatic \"driver\" mutations. To search for such driver-lncRNAs, we here\u00a0perform a genome-wide analysis of fitness-altering single nucleotide variants (SNVs) across a cohort of 2583 primary and 3527 metastatic tumours. The resulting 54 mutated and positively-selected lncRNAs are significantly enriched for previously-reported cancer genes and a range of clinical and genomic features. A number of these lncRNAs promote tumour cell proliferation when overexpressed in in vitro models. Our results also highlight a dense SNV hotspot in the widely-studied NEAT1 oncogene. To directly evaluate the functional significance of NEAT1 SNVs, we use in cellulo mutagenesis to introduce tumour-like mutations in the gene and observe a significant and reproducible increase in cell fitness, both in vitro and in a mouse model. Mechanistic studies reveal that SNVs remodel the NEAT1 ribonucleoprotein and boost subnuclear paraspeckles. In summary, this work demonstrates the utility of driver analysis for mapping cancer-promoting lncRNAs, and provides experimental evidence that somatic mutations can act through lncRNAs to enhance pathological cancer cell fitness.",

The purpose of this study is to construct a prognostic risk model for ccRCC by analysing the differential marker genes related to immune cells in the single-cell database to provide help in clinical diagnosis and targeted therapy. Single-cell data and ligand-receptor relationship pair data were downloaded from related publications, and ccRCC phenotype and expression profile data were downloaded from TCGA and CPTAC. Based on the DEGs of each cluster acquired from single-cell data, immune cell marker genes, and ligand-receptor gene data, we constructed a multilayer network. Then, the genes in the network and the genes in TCGA were used to construct the WGCNA network, which screened out prognosis-associated genes for subsequent analysis. Finally, a prognostic risk scoring model was obtained, and CPTAC data showed that the effectiveness of this model was good. A nomogram based on the predictive model for predicting the overall survival was established, and internal validation was performed well. Our findings suggest that the predictive model built and based on the immune cell scRNA-seq will enable us to judge the prognosis of patients with ccRCC and provide more accurate directions for basic relevant research and clinical practice.",

			"abstract": "The role of B cells in antitumor immunity has been reported to be either promotive or suppressive, but the specific mechanism remains to be comprehensively understood. However, this complicated situation likely depends on the temporal and spatial relationship between the developing tumor and B cells that recognize tumor antigens. Unlike responses against microbial or pathogenic infections, tumor cells are derived from autologous cells that have mutated and become aberrant; thus, elimination by the adaptive immune system is essentially inefficient. If tumor cells can evade immune attack at an early stage, non-destructive responses, such as tolerance and immunosuppression, are established over time. In tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs), tumor antigen-reactive B cells potentially acquire immunoregulatory phenotypes and contribute to an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Therefore, triggering and enhancing antitumor responses by immunotherapies require selective control of these regulatory B cell subsets in TDLNs. In contrast, B cell infiltration and formation of tertiary lymphoid structures in tumors are positively correlated with therapeutic prognosis, suggesting that tumor antigen-specific activation of B cells and antibody production are advantageous for antitumor immunity in mid- to late-stage tumors. Given that the presence of B cells in tumor tissues may reflect the ongoing antitumor response in TDLNs, therapeutic induction and enhancement of these lymphocytes are expected to increase the overall effectiveness of immunotherapy. Therefore, B cells are promising targets, but the spatiotemporal balance of the subsets that exhibit opposite characteristics, that is, the protumor or antitumor state in TDLNs, should be understood, and strategies to separately control their functions should be developed to maximize the clinical outcome.",

			"abstract": "Precision oncology relies on the accurate molecular characterization of individual patients with cancer at the time of treatment initiation. However, tumor molecular profiles are not static, and cancers continually evolve because of ongoing mutagenesis and clonal selection. Here, we performed genomic analyses of primary tumors, metastases, and plasma collected from individual patients to define the concordance of actionable genomic alterations and to identify drivers of metastatic disease progression. We observed a high degree of discordance of actionable genomic alterations, with 23% discordant between primary and metastatic disease sites. Among chromatin-modifying genes, ARID1A mutations, when discordant, were exclusive to the metastatic tumor samples. Our findings indicate that the high degree of lesion-to-lesion genomic heterogeneity may be a barrier to precision oncology approaches for bladder cancer and that circulating tumor DNA profiling may be preferred to tumor sequencing for a subset of patients.",

Epistasis is prevalent in nature, including populations of viruses, bacteria, and cancers, and can contribute to the evolution of drug resistance and immune escape. However, it is difficult to directly estimate epistatic effects from sampled observations of a population. At present, there are very few methods that can disentangle the effects of selection (including epistasis), mutation, recombination, genetic drift, and genetic linkage in evolving populations. Here we develop a method to infer epistasis, along with the fitness effects of individual mutations, from observed evolutionary histories. Simulations show that we can accurately infer pairwise epistatic interactions provided that there is sufficient genetic diversity in the data. Our method also allows us to identify which fitness parameters can be reliably inferred from a particular data set and which ones are unidentifiable. Our approach therefore allows for the inference of more complex models of selection from time-series genetic data, while also quantifying uncertainty in the inferred parameters.",

One of the major cellular constituents of TME, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are known to interact with cancer cells and promote colorectal carcinogenesis. The accumulation of these activated fibroblasts is linked to poor diagnosis in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and recurrence of the disease. However, the interplay between cancer cells and CAFs is yet to be described, especially in relation to the sidedness of colorectal carcinogenesis. CRC, which is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer globally, can be classified according to the anatomical region from which they originate: left-sided (LCRC) and right-sided CRC (RCR). Both cancers differ in many aspects, including in histology, evolution, and molecular signatures. Despite occurring at lower frequency, RCRC is often associated with worse diagnosis compared to LCRC. The differences in molecular profiles between RCRC and LCRC also influence the mode of treatment that can be used to specifically target these cancer entities. A better understanding of the cancer cell-CAF interplay and its association with RCRC and LRCR progression will provide better insight into potential translational aspects of targeted treatment for CRC.",

			"abstract": "Mutational processes in tumors create distinctive patterns of mutations, composed of neutral \"passenger\" mutations and oncogenic drivers that have quantifiable effects on the proliferation and survival of cancer cell lineages. Increases in proliferation and survival are mediated by natural selection, which can be quantified by comparing the frequency at which we detect substitutions to the frequency at which we expect to detect substitutions assuming neutrality. Most of the variants detectable with whole-exome sequencing in tumors are neutral or nearly neutral in effect, and thus the processes generating the majority of mutations may not be the primary sources of the tumorigenic mutations. Across 24 cancer types, we identify the contributions of mutational processes to each oncogenic variant and quantify the degree to which each process contributes to tumorigenesis. We demonstrate that the origination of variants driving melanomas and lung cancers is predominantly attributable to the preventable, exogenous mutational processes associated with ultraviolet light and tobacco exposure, respectively, whereas the origination of selected variants in gliomas and prostate adenocarcinomas is largely attributable to endogenous processes associated with aging. Preventable mutations associated with pathogen exposure and apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme activity account for a large proportion of the cancer effect within head-and-neck, bladder, cervical, and breast cancers. These attributions complement epidemiological approaches-revealing the burden of cancer driven by single-nucleotide variants caused by either endogenous or exogenous, nonpreventable, or preventable processes, and crucially inform public health strategies.",

While the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies has facilitated the large-scale capture of genomic data, the field of single-cell genomics is nascent but rapidly advancing and generating many new insights into the complex molecular mechanisms of tumour biology. In this review, we provide an overview of current single-cell DNA sequencing technologies, exploring how recent methodological advancements have enumerated new insights into ITH and tumour evolution. Areas highlighted include the potential power of single-cell genome sequencing studies to explore evolutionary dynamics contributing to tumourigenesis through to progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance. We also explore the use of in situ sequencing technologies to study ITH in a spatial context, as well as examining the use of single-cell genomics to perform lineage tracing in both normal and malignant tissues. Finally, we consider the use of multimodal single-cell sequencing technologies. Taken together, it is hoped that these many facets of single-cell genome sequencing will improve our understanding of tumourigenesis, progression, and lethality in cancer, leading to the development of novel therapies. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

The packaging and release of EVs appears to be a bulk-flow process which takes place mainly under extreme conditions. EVs participate in horizontal gene transfer, which supports the survival of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes. In higher eukaryotes, almost all cells secrete a heterogeneous population of EVs loaded with various biomolecules. EV secretion is typically higher in cancer microenvironments, promoting tumor progression and metastasis. EVs are now recognized as additional mediators of autocrine and paracrine communication in health and disease. In this context, proteins and RNAs have been studied the most, but extracellular vesicle DNA (EV-DNA) has started to gain in importance in the last few years. In this review, we summarize new findings related to the loading mechanism(s), localization, and post-shedding function of EV-DNA. We also discuss the feasibility of using EV-DNA as a biomarker when performing a liquid biopsy, at the same time emphasizing the lack of data from clinical trials in this regard. Finally, we outline the potential of EV-DNA uptake and its interaction with the host genome as a promising tool for understanding the mechanisms of cancer evolution.",

However, high sequencing error rates of current SCGS data, i.e., false positives, false negatives, and missing bases, severely limit its application. Here, we present a deep learning framework, RDAClone, to recover genotype matrices from noisy data with an extended robust deep autoencoder, cluster cells into subclones by the Louvain-Jaccard method, and further infer evolutionary relationships between subclones by the minimum spanning tree. Studies on both simulated and real datasets demonstrate its robustness and superiority in data denoising, cell clustering, and evolutionary tree reconstruction, particularly for large datasets.",

Interactions between clones can affect tumour evolution and hence disease progression and treatment outcome. Intra-tumoural pairs of mutations that are overrepresented in a co-occurring or clonally exclusive fashion over a cohort of patient samples may be suggestive of a synergistic effect between the different clones carrying these mutations. We therefore developed a novel statistical testing framework, called GeneAccord, to identify such gene pairs that are altered in distinct subclones of the same tumour. We analysed our framework for calibration and power. By comparing its performance to baseline methods, we demonstrate that to control type I errors, it is essential to account for the evolutionary dependencies among clones. In applying GeneAccord to the single-cell sequencing of a cohort of 123 acute myeloid leukaemia patients, we find 1 clonally co-occurring and 8 clonally exclusive gene pairs. The clonally exclusive pairs mostly involve genes of the key signalling pathways.",

Intra-tumoral heterogeneity (ITH) is detectable within a single tumor in which cancer cell subpopulations with different genome features coexist in a patient in different tumor areas or may evolve/differ over time. Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is characterized by heterogeneous features involving genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic alterations. The study of ITH is a promising new frontier to lay the foundation towards successful CRC diagnosis and treatment. Genome and transcriptome sequencing together with editing technologies are revolutionizing biomedical research, representing the most promising tools for overcoming unmet clinical and research challenges. Rapid advances in both bulk and single-cell next-generation sequencing (NGS) are identifying primary and metastatic intratumoral genomic and transcriptional heterogeneity. They provide critical insight in the origin and spatiotemporal evolution of genomic clones responsible for early and late therapeutic resistance and relapse. Single-cell technologies can be used to define subpopulations within a known cell type by searching for differential gene expression within the cell population of interest and/or effectively isolating signal from rare cell populations that would not be detectable by other methods. Each single-cell sequencing analysis is driven by clustering of cells based on their differentially expressed genes. Genes that drive clustering can be used as unique markers for a specific cell population. In this review we analyzed, starting from published data, the possible achievement of a transition from clinical CRC research to precision medicine with an emphasis on new single-cell based techniques; at the same time, we focused on all approaches and issues related to this promising technology. This transition might enable noninvasive screening for early diagnosis, individualized prediction of therapeutic response, and discovery of additional novel drug targets.",

SI-NET also shows an unusual absence of driver mutations explaining tumor initiation and metastatic spread. The evolutionary trajectories that underlie multifocal SI-NET lesions could provide insight into the underlying tumor biology, but this question remains unresolved. Here, we determine the complete genome sequences of 61 tumors and metastases from 11 patients with multifocal SI-NET, allowing for elucidation of phylogenetic relationships between tumors within single patients. Intra-individual comparisons revealed a lack of shared somatic single-nucleotide variants among the sampled intestinal lesions, supporting an independent clonal origin. Furthermore, in three of the patients, two independent tumors had metastasized. We conclude that primary multifocal SI-NETs generally arise from clonally independent cells, suggesting a contribution from a cancer-priming local factor.",

Breast cancer is a dynamic entity, changing during tumor progression and metastatization and this poses fundamental issues to the feasibility of a personalized medicine approach. The most effective therapeutic strategy for patients with recurrent disease should be assessed evaluating biopsies obtained from metastatic sites.

Fusion genes have the potential to create chimeric RNAs, which can generate the phenotypic diversity of cancer cells, and could be associated with novel molecular functions related to cancer cell survival and proliferation. The expression of chimeric RNAs in cancer cells might impact diverse cancer-related functions, including loss of apoptosis and cancer cell plasticity, and promote oncogenesis. Due to their recurrence in cancers and functional association with oncogenic processes, chimeric RNAs are considered biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. Several recent studies demonstrated that chimeric RNAs could lead to the generation of new functionality for the resistance of cancer cells against drug therapy. Therefore, targeting chimeric RNAs in drug resistance cancer could be useful for developing precision medicine. So, understanding the functional impact of chimeric RNAs in cancer cells from an evolutionary perspective will be helpful to elucidate cancer evolution, which could provide a new insight to design more effective therapies for cancer patients in a personalized manner.",

Two limiting factors for clonal deconvolution that have remained unresolved are variation in purity and chromosomal copy number across different samples of the same tumor. We developed a semi-supervised algorithm that tracks variant calls through multi-sample spatiotemporal tumor data. While normalizing allele frequencies based on purity, it also adjusts for copy number changes at clonal deconvolution. Absent \u00e0 priori copy number data, it renders in silico copy number estimations from bulk sequences. Using published and simulated tumor sequences, we reliably segregated clonal/subclonal variants even at a low sequencing depth (~50\u00d7). Given at least one pure tumor sample (>70% purity), we could normalize and deconvolve paired samples down to a purity of 40%. This renders a reliable clonal reconstruction well adapted to multi-regionally sampled solid tumors, which are often aneuploid and contaminated by non-cancer cells.",

These efforts depend on large and high-confidence collections of cancer lncRNAs. Here, we present the Cancer LncRNA Census 2 (CLC2). With 492 cancer lncRNAs, CLC2 is 4-fold greater in size than its predecessor, without compromising on strict criteria of confident functional/genetic roles and inclusion in the GENCODE annotation scheme. This increase was enabled by leveraging high-throughput transposon insertional mutagenesis screening data, yielding 92 novel cancer lncRNAs. CLC2 makes a valuable addition to existing collections: it is amongst the largest, contains numerous unique genes (not found in other databases) and carries functional labels (oncogene/tumour suppressor). Analysis of this dataset reveals that cancer lncRNAs are impacted by germline variants, somatic mutations and changes in expression consistent with inferred disease functions. Furthermore, we show how clinical/genomic features can be used to vet prospective gene sets from high-throughput sources. The combination of size and quality makes CLC2 a foundation for precision medicine, demonstrating cancer lncRNAs' evolutionary and clinical significance.",

CLICnet employs Restricted Boltzmann Machines, a type of generative neural network, which allows for the capture of complex mutational patterns associated with patient survival in different cancer types. For some cancer types, clustering produced by CLICnet also predicts benefit from anti-PD1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy, whereas for other cancer types, the mutational processes associated with survival are different from those associated with the improved anti-PD1 survival benefit. Thus, CLICnet has the ability to systematically identify and catalogue combinations of mutations that predict cancer survival, unveiling intricate associations between mutations, survival, and immunotherapy benefit.",

We are now at a pivotal point where accumulating evidence starts to steer the future directions of the discipline and allows us to underpin the key challenges that remain to be addressed. Here, we aim to assess current advancements in the field and to suggest future directions for research. First, we summarize cancer research areas that, so far, have assimilated ecological and evolutionary principles into their approaches and illustrate their key importance. Then, we assembled 33 experts and identified 84 key questions, organized around nine major themes, to pave the foundations for research to come. We highlight the urgent need for broadening the portfolio of research directions to stimulate novel approaches at the interface of oncology and ecological and evolutionary sciences.

			"abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors provide considerable therapeutic benefit in a range of solid cancers as well as in a subgroup of hematological malignancies. Response rates are however suboptimal, and despite considerable efforts, predicting response to immune checkpoint inhibitors ahead of their administration in a given patient remains elusive. The study of the dynamics of the immune system and of the tumor under immune checkpoint blockade brought insight into the mechanisms of action of these therapeutic agents. Equally relevant are the mechanisms of adaptive resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors that have been uncovered through this approach. In this review, we discuss the dynamics of the immune system and of the tumor under immune checkpoint blockade emanating from recent studies on animal models and humans. We will focus on mechanisms of action and of resistance conveying information predictive of therapeutic response.",

			"abstract": "Liquid biopsy, which generally refers to the analysis of biological components such as circulating nuclear acids and circulating tumor cells in body fluids, particularly in peripheral blood, has shown good capacity to overcome several limitations faced by conventional tissue biopsies. Emerging evidence in recent decades has confirmed the promising role of liquid biopsy in the clinical management of various cancers, including colorectal cancer, which is one of the most prevalent cancers and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite the challenges and poor clinical outcomes, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer can expect potential clinical benefits with liquid biopsy. Therefore, in this review, we focus on the clinical prospects of liquid biopsy in metastatic colorectal cancer, specifically with regard to the recently discovered various biomarkers identified on liquid biopsy. These biomarkers have been shown to be potentially useful in multiple aspects of metastatic colorectal cancer, such as auxiliary diagnosis of metastasis, prognosis prediction, and monitoring of therapy response.",

			"abstract": "Cancer is driven by somatic mutations that result in a cellular fitness advantage. This selective advantage is expected to be counterbalanced by the immune system when these driver mutations simultaneously lead to the generation of neoantigens, novel peptides that are presented at the cancer cell membrane via HLA molecules from the MHC complex. The presentability of these peptides is determined by a patient's MHC genotype and it has been suggested that this results in MHC genotype-specific restrictions of the oncogenic mutational landscape. Here, we generated a set of virtual patients, each with an identical and prototypical MHC genotype, and show that the earlier reported HLA affinity differences between observed and unobserved mutations are unrelated to MHC genotype variation. We demonstrate how these differences are secondary to high frequencies of 13 hot spot driver mutations in 6 different genes. Several oncogenic mechanisms were identified that lower the peptides' HLA affinity, including phospho-mimicking substitutions in BRAF, destabilizing tyrosine mutations in TP53 and glycine-rich mutational contexts in the GTP-binding KRAS domain. In line with our earlier findings, our results emphasize that HLA affinity predictions are easily misinterpreted when studying immunogenic selection processes.",

In recent years, the development of specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) for the therapeutic benefit of patients harboring certain molecular aberrations and the introduction of prospective molecular profiling in the clinical practice have revolutionized the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the identification of the best strategies to enhance treatment effectiveness and to avoid the critical phenomenon of drug tolerance and acquired resistance in patients with lung cancer still remains an unmet medical need.

			"abstract": "Historically, studies of disseminated tumour cells in bone marrow and circulating tumour cells in peripheral blood have provided crucial insights into cancer biology and the metastatic process. More recently, advances in the detection and characterization of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) have finally enabled the introduction of liquid biopsy assays into clinical practice. The FDA has already approved several single-gene assays and, more recently, multigene assays to detect genetic alterations in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) for use as companion diagnostics matched to specific molecularly targeted therapies for cancer. These approvals mark a tipping point for the widespread use of liquid biopsy in the clinic, and mostly in patients with advanced-stage cancer. The next frontier for the clinical application of liquid biopsy is likely to be the systemic treatment of patients with 'ctDNA relapse', a term we introduce for ctDNA detection prior to imaging-detected relapse after curative-intent therapy for early stage disease. Cancer screening and diagnosis are other potential future applications. In this Perspective, we discuss key issues and gaps in technology, clinical trial methodologies and logistics for the eventual integration of liquid biopsy into the clinical workflow.",

In this review, we summarized the recent advances of ecDNA in oncogenesis and oncotherapy. ecDNA consists of highly open chromatin, and its circular structure enables ultra-long-range chromatin contacts. ecDNA is not inherited in accordance with Mendel's laws. Furthermore, ecDNA is widely existed in cancer cells, but almost never found in normal cells. It has been found that ecDNA played important roles in tumorigenesis and tumor progression, including oncogene amplification, tumor heterogeneity, enhancer hijacking and genomic rearrangement. More importantly, ecDNA is closely related to cancer treatment resistance. In hence, further understanding of ecDNA would contribute to developing innovative targeting ecDNA therapies.",

It utilizes the partial information about the orders of mutation events provided by cancer mutation trees and extends it by inferring full evolutionary history and mutability landscape of a tumor. Evaluation of mutation rates on the level of subclones rather than individual genes allows to capture the effects of genomic interactions and epistasis. We estimate the accuracy of our approach and demonstrate that it can be used to study the evolution of genetic instability and infer tumor evolutionary history from experimental data.

The precise molecular features that characterize the contributions of multiscale intratumour heterogeneity to malignant progression, metastasis, and poor survival are largely unknown. Here, we address these challenges in breast cancer by defining the landscape of heterogeneous tumour subclones and their biological functions using radiogenomic signatures. Molecular heterogeneity is identified by a fully unsupervised deconvolution of gene expression data. Relative prevalence of two subclones associated with cell cycle and primary immunodeficiency pathways identifies patients with significantly different survival outcomes. Radiogenomic signatures of imaging scale heterogeneity are extracted and used to classify patients into groups with distinct subclone compositions. Prognostic value is confirmed by survival analysis accounting for clinical variables. These findings provide insight into how a radiogenomic analysis can identify the biological activities of specific subclones that predict prognosis in a noninvasive and clinically relevant manner.",

We then inferred SVs and large-scale allele-specific copy number variants (CNVs) using an ensemble of methods. Our findings show that long-read sequencing allows for substantially more accurate and sensitive SV detection, with between 90% and 95% of variants supported by each long-read technology also supported by the other. We also report high accuracy for long reads even at relatively low coverage (25\u00d7-30\u00d7). Furthermore, we integrated SV and CNV data into a unifying karyotype-graph structure to present a more accurate representation of the mutated cancer genomes. We find hundreds of variants within known cancer-related genes detectable only through long-read sequencing.

			"abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common intestinal cancer with a high mortality rate. Early detection of this type of cancer is fundamental to the prevention of the disease, which results in improved survival rates. In the human colon tissue, transition from normal epithelium to adenoma is considered to be caused by unknown molecular incidents occurring over 5-10 years. The detection of CRC has proved problematic when in the early stages of disease. In addition, identifying suitable biomarkers for the detection of CRC progress in patients remains one of the most significant challenges. Long non-coding RNAs have been demonstrated to contribute to the promotion of CRC. The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical and biological significance of long intergenic non-coding (linc)RNA-p21, lincRNA-regulator of reprogramming (ROR) and metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) in the colon tumor and polyp tissue, and the association that these have with the expression of p53 at the mRNA level. Neoplastic and paired adjacent normal tissue samples were obtained from 72 patients (46 polyps and 26 tumors). Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was performed to determine the relative fold changes in the expression of lincRNA-p21, lincRNA-RoR, MALAT1 and p53 in the samples. A significant association was observed between the levels of MALAT1 and p53 in neoplasm tissues (R=0.073; P<0.05). The relative expression of the MALAT1 gene revealed a statistically significant difference between the different polyp types and number of polyps (P=0.0028 and 0.022, respectively). Adjuvant therapy in patients with tumors revealed an association between the levels of lincRNA-ROR and lincRNA-p21 expression (P=0.015 and 0.038, respectively). MALAT1 may be selected as an early detection biomarker for CRC. Furthermore, lincRNA-ROR and lincRNA-p21 may serve as prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers in patients with CRC.",

Thus far, a number of evolutionary processes have been proposed to be working in cancer evolution. However, there exists no simulation model that can describe the different evolutionary processes in a unified manner. In this study, we constructed a unified simulation model for describing the different evolutionary processes and performed sensitivity analysis on the model to determine the conditions in which cancer growth is driven by each of the different evolutionary processes. Our sensitivity analysis has successfully provided a series of novel insights into the evolutionary dynamics of cancer. For example, we found that, while a high neutral mutation rate shapes neutral intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) characterized by a fractal-like pattern, a stem cell hierarchy can also contribute to shaping neutral ITH by apparently increasing the mutation rate. Although It has been reported that the evolutionary principle shaping ITH shifts from selection to accumulation of neutral mutations during colorectal tumorigenesis, our simulation revealed the possibility that this evolutionary shift is triggered by drastic evolutionary events that occur in a short time and confer a marked fitness increase on one or a few cells. This result helps us understand that each process works not separately but simultaneously and continuously as a series of phases of cancer evolution. Collectively, this study serves as a basis to understand in greater depth the diversity of cancer evolution.",

Loss of several known tumor suppressors enhances cellular proliferation and transformation. Loss of neddylation pathway genes promotes uncontrolled proliferation exclusively in TP53-deficient cells. Combined loss of CUL3 and TP53 activates an oncogenic transcriptional program governed by the nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB), AP-1, and transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) pathways. This program maintains persistent cellular proliferation, induces partial epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and increases DNA damage, genomic instability, and chromosomal rearrangements. Our findings reveal CUL3 loss as a key event stimulating persistent proliferation in TP53-deficient cells. These findings may be clinically relevant, since TP53-CUL3-deficient cells are highly sensitive to ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) inhibition, exposing a vulnerability that could be exploited for cancer treatment.",

			"abstract": "Recently, an increasing number of studies sequence multiple biopsies of primary tumors, and even paired metastatic tumors to understand heterogeneity and the evolutionary trajectory of cancer progression. Although several algorithms are available to infer the phylogeny, most tools rely on accurate measurements of mutation allele frequencies from deep sequencing, which is often hard to achieve for clinical samples (especially FFPE samples). In this study, we present a novel and easy-to-use method, PTI (Phylogenetic Tree Inference), which use an iterative top-down approach to infer the phylogenetic tree structure of multiple tumor biopsies from same patient using just the presence or absence of somatic mutations without their allele frequencies. Therefore PTI can be used in a wide range of cases even when allele frequency data is not available. Comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods, such as LICHeE, Treeomics, and BAMSE, shows that PTI achieves similar or slightly better performance within a short run time. Moreover, this method is generally applicable to infer phylogeny for any other data sets (such as epigenetics) with a similar zero and one feature-by-sample matrix.",

Furthermore, it remains debated whether mutated lncRNAs can drive tumorigenesis, and whether such functions could be conserved during evolution. Here, as part of the ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium, we introduce the Cancer LncRNA Census (CLC), a compilation of 122 GENCODE lncRNAs with causal roles in cancer phenotypes. In contrast to existing databases, CLC requires strong functional or genetic evidence. CLC genes are enriched amongst driver genes predicted from somatic mutations, and display characteristic genomic features. Strikingly, CLC genes are enriched for driver mutations from unbiased, genome-wide transposon-mutagenesis screens in mice. We identified 10 tumour-causing mutations in orthologues of 8 lncRNAs, including LINC-PINT and NEAT1, but not MALAT1. Thus CLC represents a dataset of high-confidence cancer lncRNAs. Mutagenesis maps are a novel means for identifying deeply-conserved roles of lncRNAs in tumorigenesis.",

GBM, at diagnosis or after treatment, are resistant to temozolomide (TMZ), the standard chemotherapy. To better understand the acquisition of this resistance, we performed a longitudinal study, using a combination of mathematical models, RNA sequencing, single cell analyses, functional and drug assays in a human glioma cell line (U251). After an initial response characterized by cell death induction, cells entered a transient state defined by slow growth, a distinct morphology and a shift of metabolism. Specific genes expression associated to this population revealed chromatin remodeling. Indeed, the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin (TSA), specifically eliminated this population and thus prevented the appearance of fast growing TMZ-resistant cells. In conclusion, we have identified in glioblastoma a population with tolerant-like features, which could constitute a therapeutic target.",

We prioritized genes that encode secreted proteins according to their preferential expression in normal lungs to identify candidates associated with lung cancer. Indeed, most of the lung-enriched genes identified in our analysis have known or suspected roles in lung cancer. We focused on the gene encoding neuron-derived neurotrophic factor (NDNF), which had not yet been associated with lung cancer. We determined that NDNF was preferentially expressed in the normal adult lung and that its expression was decreased in human lung adenocarcinoma and a mouse model of this cancer. Higher expression of NDNF was associated with better clinical outcome of patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Purified NDNF inhibited proliferation of lung cancer cells, whereas silencing NDNF promoted tumor cell growth in culture and in xenograft models. We determined that NDNF is downregulated through DNA hypermethylation near CpG island shores in human lung adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, the lung cancer-related DNA hypermethylation sites corresponded to the methylation sites that occurred in tissues with low NDNF expression. Thus, by analyzing the tissue-specific secretome, we identified a tumor-suppressive factor, NDNF, which is associated with patient outcomes in lung adenocarcinoma.",

Examination of the clonal composition of an individual tumor and its evolution through disease progression and treatment may enable identification of precise therapeutic targets for drug design. Multi-region and single-cell sequencing are powerful tools that can be used to capture intratumor heterogeneity. Here, we present a database we've named CancerTracer (http://cailab.labshare.cn/cancertracer): a manually curated database designed to track and characterize the evolutionary trajectories of tumor growth in individual patients. We collected over 6000 tumor samples from 1548 patients corresponding to 45 different types of cancer. Patient-specific tumor phylogenetic trees were constructed based on somatic mutations or copy number alterations identified in multiple biopsies. Using the structured heterogeneity data, researchers can identify common driver events shared by all tumor regions, and the heterogeneous somatic events present in different regions of a tumor of interest. The database can also be used to investigate the phylogenetic relationships between primary and metastatic tumors. It is our hope that CancerTracer will significantly improve our understanding of the evolutionary histories of tumors, and may facilitate the identification of predictive biomarkers for personalized cancer therapies.",

			"abstract": "Accumulation and selection of somatic mutations in a Darwinian framework result in intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) that poses significant challenges to the diagnosis and clinical therapy of cancer. Identification of the tumor cell populations (clones) and reconstruction of their evolutionary relationship can elucidate this heterogeneity. Recently developed single-cell DNA sequencing (SCS) technologies promise to resolve ITH to a single-cell level. However, technical errors in SCS data sets, including false-positives (FP) and false-negatives (FN) due to allelic dropout, and cell doublets, significantly complicate these tasks. Here, we propose a nonparametric Bayesian method that reconstructs the clonal populations as clusters of single cells, genotypes of each clone, and the evolutionary relationship between the clones. It employs a tree-structured Chinese restaurant process as the prior on the number and composition of clonal populations. The evolution of the clonal populations is modeled by a clonal phylogeny and a finite-site model of evolution to account for potential mutation recurrence and losses. We probabilistically account for FP and FN errors, and cell doublets are modeled by employing a Beta-binomial distribution. We develop a Gibbs sampling algorithm comprising partial reversible-jump and partial Metropolis-Hastings updates to explore the joint posterior space of all parameters. The performance of our method on synthetic and experimental data sets suggests that joint reconstruction of tumor clones and clonal phylogeny under a finite-site model of evolution leads to more accurate inferences. Our method is the first to enable this joint reconstruction in a fully Bayesian framework, thus providing measures of support of the inferences it makes.",

We argue that these phenomena are, at least partially, explainable by the evolutionary ecology of organs' theory, in the same way that environmental adversity shapes mutation rates and level of polymorphism in organisms. Organs in organisms can be considered as specialized ecosystems that are, for ecological and evolutionary reasons, more or less efficient at suppressing tumours. When a malignancy does arise in an organ applying strong selection pressure on tumours, its constituent cells are expected to display a large range of possible surviving strategies, from hyper mutator phenotypes relying on bet-hedging to persist (high mutation rates and high diversity), to few poorly variable variants that become invisible to natural defences. In contrast, when tumour suppression is weaker, selective pressure favouring extreme surviving strategies is relaxed, and tumours are moderately variable as a result. We provide a comprehensive overview of this hypothesis. Lay summary: Different levels of mutations and intra-tumour heterogeneity have been observed between cancer types and organs. Anti-cancer defences are unequal between our organs. We propose that mostly aggressive neoplasms (i.e. higher mutational and ITH levels), succeed in emerging and developing in organs with strong defences.",

While it is well-established that intratumor, subclonal genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity significantly contribute to resistance, it is not fully understood how tumor sub-clones interact with each other to withstand therapy pressure. Here, we report a previously unrecognized behavior in heterogeneous tumors: cooperative adaptation to therapy (CAT), in which cancer cells induce co-resistant phenotypes in neighboring cancer cells when exposed to cancer therapy. Using a CRISPR/Cas9 toolkit we engineered phenotypically diverse non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells by conferring mutations in Dicer1, a type III cytoplasmic endoribonuclease involved in small non-coding RNA genesis. We monitored three-dimensional growth dynamics of fluorescently-labeled mutant and/or wild-type cells individually or in co-culture using a substrate-free NanoCulture system under unstimulated or drug pressure conditions. By integrating mathematical modeling with flow cytometry, we characterized the growth patterns of mono- and co-cultures using a mathematical model of intra- and interspecies competition. Leveraging the flow cytometry data, we estimated the model's parameters to reveal that the combination of WT and mutants in co-cultures allowed for beneficial growth in previously drug sensitive cells despite drug pressure via induction of cell state transitions described by a cooperative game theoretic change in the fitness values. Finally, we used an ex vivo human tumor model that predicts clinical response through drug sensitivity analyses and determined that cellular and morphologic heterogeneity correlates to prognostic failure of multiple clinically-approved and off-label drugs in individual NSCLC patient samples. Together, these findings present a new paradox in drug resistance implicating non-genetic cooperation among tumor cells to thwart drug pressure, suggesting that profiling for druggable targets (i.e. mutations) alone may be insufficient to assign effective therapy.",

This method was applied to a wide range of tumors and normal tissues. We identify high similarity between repeat instability patterns in tumors and their patient-matched adjacent normal tissues. Nonetheless, tumor-specific signatures both in protein expression and in the genome strongly correlate with cancer progression and robustly predict the tumorigenic state. In a patient, the hierarchy of genomic repeat instability signatures accurately reconstructs tumor evolution, with primary tumors differentiated from metastases. We observe an inverse relationship between repeat instability and point mutation load within and across patients independent of other somatic aberrations. Thus, repeat instability is a distinct, transient, and compensatory adaptive mechanism in tumor evolution and a potential signal for early detection.",

Using this framework, we found that premalignant skin and colorectal lesions appeared specifically adapted to their local environment, yet insufficiently for full cancerous transformation. We found that metastatic clones were more adapted to the site of origin than to the invaded tissue, suggesting that genetics may be more important for local progression than for the invasion of distant organs. In addition, we used network analyses to investigate evolutionary properties at the system-level, highlighting that different dynamics of malignant progression can be modelled by such a framework in tumour-type-specific fashion. We find that occurrence-based methods can be used to specifically recapitulate the process of cancer initiation and progression, as well as to evaluate the adaptation of genetic clones to given environments. The repeatability observed in the evolution of most tumour types could therefore be harnessed to better predict the trajectories likely to be taken by tumours and preneoplastic lesions in the future.",

			"abstract": "Accelerating technological advances have allowed the widespread genomic profiling of tumors. As yet, however, the vast catalogues of mutations that have been identified have made only a modest impact on clinical medicine. Massively parallel sequencing has informed our understanding of the genetic evolution and heterogeneity of cancers, allowing us to place these mutational catalogues into a meaningful context. Here, we review the methods used to measure tumor evolution and heterogeneity, and the potential and challenges for translating the insights gained to achieve clinical impact for cancer therapy, monitoring, early detection, risk stratification, and prevention. We discuss how tumor evolution can guide cancer therapy by targeting clonal and subclonal mutations both individually and in combination. Circulating tumor DNA and circulating tumor cells can be leveraged for monitoring the efficacy of therapy and for tracking the emergence of resistant subclones. The evolutionary history of tumors can be deduced for late-stage cancers, either directly by sampling precursor lesions or by leveraging computational approaches to infer the timing of driver events. This approach can identify recurrent early driver mutations that represent promising avenues for future early detection strategies. Emerging evidence suggests that mutational processes and complex clonal dynamics are active even in normal development and aging. This will make discriminating developing malignant neoplasms from normal aging cell lineages a challenge. Furthermore, insight into signatures of mutational processes that are active early in tumor evolution may allow the development of cancer-prevention approaches. Research and clinical studies that incorporate an appreciation of the complex evolutionary patterns in tumors will not only produce more meaningful genomic data, but also better exploit the vulnerabilities of cancer, resulting in improved treatment outcomes.",

			"abstract": "\u115f: Some tumor cells can evolve into transmissible parasites. Notable examples include the Tasmanian devil facial tumor disease, the canine transmissible venereal tumor and transmissible cancers of mollusks. We present a hypothesis that such transmissible tumors existed in the past and that some modern animal taxa are descendants of these tumors. We expect potential candidates for SCANDALs (speciated by cancer development animals) to be simplified relatives of more complex metazoans and have genomic alterations typical for cancer progression (such as deletions of universal apoptosis genes). We considered several taxa of simplified animals for our hypothesis: dicyemida, orthonectida, myxosporea and trichoplax. Based on genomic analysis we conclude that Myxosporea appear to be the most suitable candidates for a tumor ancestry. They are simplified parasitic cnidarians that universally lack major genes implicated in cancer progression including all genes with Caspase and BCL2 domains as well as any p53 and apoptotic protease activating factor - 1 (Apaf-1) homologs, suggesting the disruption of main apoptotic pathways in their early evolutionary history. Further comparative genomics and single-cell transcriptomic studies may be helpful to test our hypothesis of speciation via a cancerous stage.

			"abstract": "Cancer development is driven by series of events involving mutations, which may become fixed in a tumor via genetic drift and selection. This process usually includes a limited number of driver (advantageous) mutations and a greater number of passenger (neutral or mildly deleterious) mutations. We focus on a real-world leukemia model evolving on the background of a germline mutation. Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) evolves to secondary myelodysplastic syndrome (sMDS) and/or secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) in 30-40%. The majority of SCN cases are due to a germline ELANE mutation. Acquired mutations in CSF3R occur in >70% sMDS/sAML associated with SCN. Hypotheses underlying our model are: an ELANE mutation causes SCN; CSF3R mutations occur spontaneously at a low rate; in fetal life, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells expands quickly, resulting in a high probability of several tens to several hundreds of cells with CSF3R truncation mutations; therapeutic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration early in life exerts a strong selective pressure, providing mutants with a growth advantage. Applying population genetics theory, we propose a novel two-phase model of disease development from SCN to sMDS. In Phase 1, hematopoietic tissues expand and produce tens to hundreds of stem cells with the CSF3R truncation mutation. Phase 2 occurs postnatally through adult stages with bone marrow production of granulocyte precursors and positive selection of mutants due to chronic G-CSF therapy to reverse the severe neutropenia. We predict the existence of the pool of cells with the mutated truncated receptor before G-CSF treatment begins. The model does not require increase in mutation rate under G-CSF treatment and agrees with age distribution of sMDS onset and clinical sequencing data.",

			"abstract": "One of the still open questions in Ewing sarcoma, a rare bone tumor with weak therapeutic options, is to identify the tumor-driving cell (sub) population and to understand the specifics in the biological network of these cells. This basic scientific insight might foster the development of more specific therapeutic target patterns. The experimental approach is based on a side population (SP) of Ewing cells, based on the model cell line CADO-ES1. The SP is established by flow cytometry and defined by the idea that tumor stem-like cells can be identified by the time-course in clearing a given artificial dye. The SP was characterized by a higher colony forming activity, by a higher differentiation potential, by higher resistance to cytotoxic drugs, and by morphology. Several SP and non-SP cell fractions and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell reference were analyzed by short read sequencing of the full transcriptome. The double-differential analysis leads to an altered expression structure of SP cells centered around the AP-1 and APC/c complex. The SP cells share only a limited proportion of the full mesenchymal stem cell stemness set of genes. This is in line with the expectation that tumor stem-like cells share only a limited subset of stemness features which are relevant for tumor survival.",

We found that such mutations can promote tumor progression by altering microRNA (miRNA) targeting efficiency and consequently affecting miRNA\u207bmRNA interactions. We identified 67,159 somatic mutations located in the 3'UTRs of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) which can alter miRNA\u207bmRNA interactions (functional somatic mutations, funcMutations), and 69.3% of these funcMutations (the degree of energy change > 12 kcal/mol) were identified to significantly promote loss of miRNA-mRNA binding. By integrating mRNA expression profiles of 21 cancer types, we found that the expression of target genes was positively correlated with the loss of absolute affinity level and negatively correlated with the gain of absolute affinity level. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that genes carrying funcMutations were significantly enriched in the MAPK and WNT signaling pathways, and analysis of regulatory modules identified eighteen miRNA modules involved with similar cellular functions. Our findings elucidate a complex relationship between miRNA, mRNA, and mutations, and suggest that 3'UTR mutations may play an important role in tumor development.",

Tumor biopsy remains the conventional means in which to sample a tumor and often presents with challenges and associated risks. Therefore, alternative sources of tumor biomarkers is needed. Liquid biopsy has gained attention due to its non-invasive sampling of tumor tissue and ability to serially assess disease via a simple blood draw over the course of treatment. Among the leading technologies developing liquid biopsy solutions, microfluidics has recently come to the fore. Microfluidic platforms offer cellular separation and analysis platforms that allow for high throughout, high sensitivity and specificity, low sample volumes and reagent costs and precise liquid controlling capabilities. These characteristics make microfluidic technology a promising tool in separating and analyzing circulating tumor biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring. In this review, the characteristics of three kinds of circulating tumor markers will be described in the context of cancer, circulating tumor cells (CTCs), exosomes, and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). The review will focus on how the introduction of microfluidic technologies has improved the separation and analysis of these circulating tumor markers.",

Through integrative analysis of 5918 tumors across 11 cancer types, we revealed that lncRNAs have undergone dramatic genomic alterations, many of which are mutually exclusive with well-known cancer genes. Using the hypothesis of functional redundancy of mutual exclusivity, we developed a computational framework to identify driver lncRNAs associated with different cancer hallmarks. Applying it to pan-cancer data, we identified 378 candidate driver lncRNAs whose genomic features highly resemble the known cancer driver genes (e.g. high conservation and early replication). We further validated the candidate driver lncRNAs involved in 'Tissue Invasion and Metastasis' in lung adenocarcinoma and breast cancer, and also highlighted their potential roles in improving clinical outcomes. In summary, we have generated a comprehensive landscape of cancer candidate driver lncRNAs that could act as a starting point for future functional explorations, as well as the identification of biomarkers and lncRNA-based target therapy.",

			"abstract": "Whole transcriptome studies typically yield large amounts of data, with expression values for all genes or transcripts of the genome. The search for genes of interest in a particular study setting can thus be a daunting task, usually relying on automated computational methods. Moreover, most biological questions imply that such a search should be performed in a multivariate setting, to take into account the inter-genes relationships. Differential expression analysis commonly yields large lists of genes deemed significant, even after adjustment for multiple testing, making the subsequent study possibilities extensive. Here, we explore the use of supervised learning methods to rank large ensembles of genes defined by their expression values measured with RNA-Seq in a typical 2 classes sample set. First, we use one of the variable importance measures generated by the random forests classification algorithm as a metric to rank genes. Second, we define the EPS (extreme pseudo-samples) pipeline, making use of VAEs (Variational Autoencoders) and regressors to extract a ranking of genes while leveraging the feature space of both virtual and comparable samples. We show that, on 12 cancer RNA-Seq data sets ranging from 323 to 1,210 samples, using either a random forests-based gene selection method or the EPS pipeline outperforms differential expression analysis for 9 and 8 out of the 12 datasets respectively, in terms of identifying subsets of genes associated with survival. These results demonstrate the potential of supervised learning-based gene selection methods in RNA-Seq studies and highlight the need to use such multivariate gene selection methods alongside the widely used differential expression analysis.",

			"abstract": "In classical models of tumorigenesis, the accumulation of tumor promoting chromosomal aberrations is described as a gradual process. Next-generation sequencing-based methods have recently revealed complex patterns of chromosomal aberrations, which are beyond explanation by these classical models of karyotypic evolution of tumor genomes. Thus, the term chromothripsis has been introduced to describe a phenomenon, where temporarily and spatially confined genomic instability results in dramatic chromosomal rearrangements limited to segments of one or a few chromosomes. Simultaneously arising and misrepaired DNA double-strand breaks are also the cause of another phenomenon called chromoplexy, which is characterized by the presence of chained translocations and interlinking deletion bridges involving several chromosomes. In this study, we demonstrate the genome-wide identification of chromosomal translocations based on the analysis of translocation-associated changes in spatial proximities of chromosome territories on the example of the cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cell line Se-Ax. We have used alterations of intra- and interchromosomal interaction probabilities as detected by genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) to infer the presence of translocations and to fine-map their breakpoints. The outcome of this analysis was subsequently compared to datasets on DNA copy number alterations and gene expression. The presence of chained translocations within the Se-Ax genome, partly connected by intervening deletion bridges, indicates a role of chromoplexy in the etiology of this cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Notably, translocation breakpoints were significantly overrepresented in genes, which highlight gene-associated biological processes like transcription or other gene characteristics as a possible cause of the observed complex rearrangements. Given the relevance of chromosomal aberrations for basic and translational research, genome-wide high-resolution analysis of structural chromosomal aberrations will gain increasing importance.",

We show that about 27% of the tumors can be assigned to statistically supported modules, most of which encompass one or two cancer types. The rest of the tumors belong to a diffuse network component suggesting lower gene specificity of driver mutations. Linear regression of the mutational loads in cancer genes was used to estimate the number of drivers required for the onset of different cancers. The mean number of drivers in known cancer genes is approximately two, with a range of one to five. Cancers that are associated with modules had more drivers than those from the diffuse network component, suggesting that unidentified and/or interchangeable drivers exist in the latter.",

Due to the increasing availability of data from large-scale tumor genome sequencing projects, genome-driven oncology may have enormous potential to change the clinical management of patients with cancer. To this end, components of tumors, which are shed into the circulation, i.e., circulating tumor cells (CTCs), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), or extracellular vesicles, are increasingly being used for monitoring tumor genomes. A growing number of publications have documented that these \"liquid biopsies\" are informative regarding response to given therapies, are capable of detecting relapse with lead time compared to standard measures, and reveal mechanisms of resistance. However, the majority of published studies relate to advanced tumor stages and the use of liquid biopsies for detection of very early malignant disease stages is less well documented. In early disease stages, strategies for analysis are in principle relatively similar to advanced stages. However, at these early stages, several factors pose particular difficulties and challenges, including the lower frequency and volume of aberrations, potentially confounding phenomena such as clonal expansions of non-tumorous tissues or the accumulation of cancer-associated mutations with age, and the incomplete insight into driver alterations. Here we discuss biology, technical complexities and clinical significance for early cancer detection and their impact on precision oncology.",

This evolutionary process can lead to the emergence of drug-resistant mutations in subclonal populations, which can hinder therapeutic intervention in patients. Data derived from massively parallel sequencing can be used to infer these subclonal populations using tumor-specific point mutations. The accurate determination of copy-number changes and tumor impurity is necessary to reliably infer subclonal populations by mutational clustering. This protocol describes how to use Sclust, a copy-number analysis method with a recently developed mutational clustering approach. In a series of simulations and comparisons with alternative methods, we have previously shown that Sclust accurately determines copy-number states and subclonal populations. Performance tests show that the method is computationally efficient, with copy-number analysis and mutational clustering taking <10 min. Sclust is designed such that even non-experts in computational biology or bioinformatics with basic knowledge of the Linux/Unix command-line syntax should be able to carry out analyses of subclonal populations.",

			"abstract": "Inverted repeats (IRs) are abundant in genomes and frequently serve as substrates for chromosomal aberrations, including gene amplification. In the early stage of amplification, repeated cycles of chromosome breakage and rearrangement, called breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB), generate a large inverted structure, which evolves into highly-amplified, complex end products. However, it remains to be determined how IRs mediate chromosome rearrangements and promote subsequent hyper-amplification and amplicon evolutions. To dissect the complex processes, we constructed repetitive structures in a yeast chromosome and selected amplified cells using genetic markers with limited expression. The genomic architecture was associated with replication stress and produced extra-/intra-chromosomal amplification. Genetic analysis revealed structure-specific endonucleases, Mus81 and Rad27, and post-replication DNA repair protein, Rad18, suppress the amplification processes. Following BFB cycles, the intra-chromosomal products undergo intensive rearrangements, such as frequent inversions and deletions, indicative of rolling-circle replication. This study presents an integrated view linking BFB cycles to hyper-amplification driven by rolling-circle replication.",

			"abstract": "At the time of their clinical manifestation, the heterogeneous group of adult and pediatric gliomas carries a wide range of diverse somatic genomic alterations, ranging from somatic single-nucleotide variants to structural chromosomal rearrangements. Somatic abnormalities may have functional consequences, such as a decrease, increase or change in mRNA transcripts, and cells pay a penalty for maintaining them. These abnormalities, therefore, must provide cells with a competitive advantage to become engrained into the glioma genome. Here, we propose a model of gliomagenesis consisting of the following five consecutive phases that glioma cells have traversed prior to clinical manifestation: (I) initial growth; (II) oncogene-induced senescence; (III) stressed growth; (IV) replicative senescence/crisis; (V) immortal growth. We have integrated the findings from a large number of studies in biology and (neuro)oncology and relate somatic alterations and other results discussed in these papers to each of these five phases. Understanding the story that each glioma tells at presentation may ultimately facilitate the design of novel, more effective therapeutic approaches.",

The commencement of large-scale cancer sequencing projects has enabled cancer genomics to join the big data revolution. One of the challenges still facing cancer genomics research is determining which are the driver mutations in an individual cancer, as these contribute only a small subset of the overall mutation profile of a tumour. Focusing primarily on somatic single nucleotide mutations in this review, we consider both coding and non-coding driver mutations, and discuss how such mutations might be identified from cancer sequencing datasets. We describe some of the tools and database that are available for the annotation of somatic variants and the identification of cancer driver genes. We also address the use of genome-wide variation in mutation load to establish background mutation rates from which to identify driver mutations under positive selection. Finally, we describe the ways in which mutational signatures can act as clues for the identification of cancer drivers, as these mutations may cause, or arise from, certain mutational processes. By defining the molecular changes responsible for driving cancer development, new cancer treatment strategies may be developed or novel preventative measures proposed.",

However, the identification of novel driver mutations as opposed to passenger (phenotypically silent or clinically irrelevant) mutations remains a major challenge. We conducted targeted exome sequencing of advanced solid tumors from 44 pre-treated patients with solid tumors including breast, colorectal and lung carcinomas, neuroendocrine tumors, sarcomas and others. We catalogued established driver mutations and putative new drivers as predicted by two distinct algorithms. The established drivers we detected were consistent with published observations. However, we also detected a significant number of mutations with driver potential never described before in each tumor type we studied. These putative drivers belong to key cell fate regulatory networks, including potentially druggable pathways. Should our observations be confirmed, they would support the hypothesis that new driver mutations are selected by treatment in clinically aggressive tumors, and indicate a need for longitudinal genomic testing of solid tumors to inform second line cancer treatment.",

Despite clinical advancements in understanding tumor biology and growth of the chemotherapeutic industry, there have been no corresponding improvements in prognosis and overall survival of HCC and PDAC. Both of these cancers have a very intimate relationship with their surrounding environment; the TME is thought to actively participate in initiating and sustaining these malignancies.

New advances in sequencing technology and clinical sample acquisition are providing insights into the phylogenetic relationship of metastases and primary tumours at the level of somatic tumour genetics while also illuminating fundamental mechanisms of the metastatic process. In addition to somatically acquired genetic heterogeneity in the tumour cells, inherited population-based genetic heterogeneity can profoundly modify metastatic biology and further complicate the development of effective, broadly applicable antimetastatic therapies.

This is most likely achieved by a lariat structure that hides the linear telomeric DNA through protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. The telomere shortening associated with DNA replication in the absence of a compensatory mechanism culminates in unmasked telomeres. Then, the subsequent activation of the DDR will define the fate of cells according to the functionality of cell cycle checkpoints. Dysfunctional telomeres can suppress cancer development by engaging replicative senescence or apoptotic pathways, but they can also promote tumour initiation. Studies in telomere dynamics and karyotype analysis underpin telomere crisis as a key event driving genomic instability. Significant attainment of telomerase or alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)-pathway to maintain telomere length may be permissive and required for clonal evolution of genomically-unstable cells during progression to malignancy.

We have previously established that growth factor signaling promotes protein depalmitoylation to foster polarized protein localization, which, in turn, drives migration and metastasis. We report protein palmitoylation as a key mechanism for the asymmetric partitioning of the cell fate determinants Numb and \u03b2-catenin through the activity of the depalmitoylating enzyme APT1. Using point mutations, we showed that specific palmitoylated residues on Numb were required for its asymmetric localization. By live-cell imaging, we showed that reciprocal interactions between APT1 and the Rho family GTPase CDC42 promoted the asymmetric localization of Numb and \u03b2-catenin to the plasma membrane. This, in turn, restricted Notch- or Wnt-responsive transcriptional activity to one daughter cell. Moreover, we showed that altering APT1 abundance changed the transcriptional signatures of MDA-MB-231 triple receptor-negative breast cancer cells, similar to changes in Notch and \u03b2-catenin-mediated Wnt signaling. We also showed that loss of APT1 depleted a specific subpopulation of tumorigenic cells in colony formation assays. Together, our findings suggest that APT1-mediated depalmitoylation is a major mechanism of asymmetric cell division that maintains Notch- and Wnt-associated protein dynamics, gene expression, and cellular functions.",

Using the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations, a surprisingly large number of cancer driver genes, ranging between 3 and 145, were estimated to confer a selective advantage in the studied primary tumors. We report a substantial amount of metastasis specific mutations and a number of novel putative metastasis driver genes.

In some patients, these lesions may never become relevant clinically whereas in others, they act together with additional pro-oncogenic hits and thereby contribute to the formation of an overt malignancy. Although some pre-malignant stages of a malignancy have been characterized, no global system to define and to classify these conditions is available. To discuss open issues related to pre-malignant phases of neoplastic disorders, a working conference was organized in Vienna in August 2015.

Expression was quantified at cell level using a single-cell segmentation algorithm. K-means clustering was used to determine co-expression patterns of epithelial cell markers and immune markers. We document for the first time the presence of epithelial cell heterogeneity within ducts, between ducts and between patients with ductal carcinoma in situ. There was moderate heterogeneity in a distribution of eight clusters within each duct (average Shannon index 0.76; range 0-1.61). Furthermore, within each patient, the average Shannon index across all ducts ranged from 0.33 to 1.02 (s.d. 0.09-0.38). As the distribution of clusters within ducts was uneven, the analysis of eight ducts might be sufficient to represent all the clusters ie within- and between-duct heterogeneity. The pattern of epithelial cell clustering was associated with the presence and type of immune infiltrates, indicating a complex interaction between the epithelial tumor and immune system for each patient. This analysis also provides the first evidence that simultaneous analysis of both the epithelial and immune/stromal components might be necessary to understand the complex milieu in ductal carcinoma in situ lesions.",

			"abstract": "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) comprise a heterogeneous group of myeloid neoplasms characterized by peripheral cytopenia, dysplasia, and a variable clinical course with about 30% risk to transform to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In the past 15 years, diagnostic evaluations, prognostication, and treatment of MDS have improved substantially. However, with the discovery of molecular markers and advent of novel targeted therapies, new challenges have emerged in the complex field of MDS. For example, MDS-related molecular lesions may be detectable in healthy individuals and increase in prevalence with age. Other patients exhibit persistent cytopenia of unknown etiology without dysplasia. Although these conditions are potential pre-phases of MDS they may also transform into other bone marrow neoplasms. Recently identified molecular, cytogenetic, and flow-based parameters may add in the delineation and prognostication of these conditions. However, no generally accepted integrated classification and no related criteria are as yet available. In an attempt to address this challenge, an international consensus group discussed these issues in a working conference in July 2016. The outcomes of this conference are summarized in the present article which includes criteria and a proposal for the classification of pre-MDS conditions as well as updated minimal diagnostic criteria of MDS. Moreover, we propose diagnostic standards to delineate between \u00b4normal\u00b4, pre-MDS, and MDS. These standards and criteria should facilitate diagnostic and prognostic evaluations in clinical studies as well as in clinical practice.",

Here, we developed the SEECancer database (http://biocc.hrbmu.edu.cn/SEECancer), which aims to present the comprehensive cancer evolutionary stage-specific somatic events (including early-specific, late-specific, relapse-specific, metastasis-specific, drug-resistant and drug-induced genomic events) and their temporal orders.

Each entry contains the somatic event, evolutionary stage, cancer type, detection approach and relevant evidence. SEECancer provides a user-friendly interface for browsing, searching and downloading evolutionary stage-specific somatic events and temporal relationships in various cancers. With increasing attention on cancer genome evolution, the necessary information in SEECancer will facilitate understanding of cancer etiology and development of evolutionary therapeutics, and help clinicians to discover biomarkers for monitoring tumor progression.",

In this study, resected lung tumors, with simultaneous blood and bone marrow samples, were analyzed to elucidate the distribution of ctDNA. Rib bone marrow, pulmonary venous blood (Pul.V) and peripheral blood (Peri.B) were obtained from 30 patients. The liquid samples were divided into cell pellets and supernatant by centrifugation; a total of 212 DNA samples were subjected to massively parallel sequencing. ctDNA was detected in 5 patients. Given that the frequency of mutations in the primary tumor was considered to be 100%, those in the other specimens were as follows; Pul.V plasma 20%, Peri.B plasma 11%, and the other samples 0%. Furthermore, ctDNA reflected the predominant mutations in the primary lesion. Clinically, the presence of ctDNA was associated with significantly poorer survival. These results suggest ctDNA \"spill over\" into an immediate outflow tract (Pul.V), and from there is disseminated to the entire body. Thus, it can be inferred that ctDNA reflects the cancer progression and could function as a prognostic marker.",

Understanding the mechanisms that produce intratumor heterogeneity is important for selecting the best treatment. Although some studies have involved intratumor heterogeneity simulations, their model settings differed substantially. Thus, only limited conditions were explored in each. Herein, we developed a general framework for simulating intratumor heterogeneity patterns and a simulator (tumopp). Tumopp offers many setting options so that simulations can be carried out under various settings. Setting options include how the cell division rate is determined, how daughter cells are placed, and how driver mutations are treated. Furthermore, to account for the cell cycle, we introduced a gamma function for the waiting time involved in cell division. Tumopp also allows simulations in a hexagonal lattice, in addition to a regular lattice that has been used in previous simulation studies. A hexagonal lattice produces a more biologically reasonable space than a regular lattice. Using tumopp, we investigated how model settings affect the growth curve and intratumor heterogeneity pattern. It was found that, even under neutrality (with no driver mutations), tumopp produced dramatically variable patterns of intratumor heterogeneity and tumor morphology, from tumors in which cells with different genetic background are well intermixed to irregular shapes of tumors with a cluster of closely related cells. This result suggests a caveat in analyzing intratumor heterogeneity with simulations with limited settings, and tumopp will be useful to explore intratumor heterogeneity patterns in various conditions.",

This heterogeneity can only be resolved through single cell analysis. Recent advances in single cell techniques allow analysis of the genome, transcriptome, epigenome and proteome in single cells at an unprecedented scale. The application of these new single cell methods to investigate the hematopoietic system has led to paradigm shifts in our understanding of cellular heterogeneity in hematopoiesis and how this is disrupted in disease.

An example is human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressing breast cancer often treated with anti-HER2 antibody therapies, such as trastuzumab. Since drug resistance is rooted mainly in tumor cell heterogeneity, we examined the drug effect in different subpopulations of SKBR3 breast cancer cells, and compared the results with a drug resistant cell line, HCC1954. Correlative light microscopy and liquid-phase scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) were used to quantitatively analyze HER2 responses upon drug binding, whereby many tens of whole cells were imaged. Trastuzumab was found to selectively cross-link and down regulate HER2 homodimers from the plasma membranes of bulk cancer cells. In contrast, HER2 resided mainly as monomers in rare subpopulations of resting- and cancer stem cells (CSCs), and these monomers were not internalized after drug binding. The HER2 distribution was hardly influenced by trastuzumab for the HCC1954 cells. These findings show that resting cells and CSCs are irresponsive to the drug, and thus point towards a molecular explanation behind the origin of drug resistance. This analytical method is broadly applicable to study membrane protein interactions in the intact plasma membrane, while accounting for cell heterogeneity.",

Using a circRNA microarray, we identified 226 differentially expressed circRNAs, of which 189 were significantly upregulated and 37 were downregulated. High expression of circRNA_100338, one of the upregulated circRNAs in HCC, is closely correlated with a low cumulative survival rate and metastatic progression in HCC patients with hepatitis B. Furthermore, our in silico and experimental analyses identified miR-141-3p as a direct target of circRNA_100338. Thus, circRNA_100338 functions as an endogenous sponge for miR-141-3p in HCC. In addition, we identified the crucial antagonistic roles of circRNA_100338 and miR-141-3p in the regulation of invasive potential in liver cancer cells. Overall, the differential expression of multiple circRNAs in HCC tissues and their clinical significance in hepatitis B-related HCC patients as revealed by our study suggests that circRNA_100338 is a potentially valuable biomarker for HCC diagnosis and target for HCC therapeutics.",

For example, Big Bang dynamics have been reported, wherein after transformation, growth occurs in the absence of stringent selection, consistent with effectively neutral evolution. Although first noted in colorectal tumors, effective neutrality may be relatively common. Additionally, punctuated evolution resulting from mutational bursts and cataclysmic genomic alterations have been described.

Since extensive chromosomal losses can generate proteotoxic stress and compromise cellular proliferation, it is intriguing how chRCC, a tumor with extensive chromosome losses and a low number of somatic mutations, can develop lethal metastases. Genomic features distinguishing metastatic from nonmetastatic chRCC are unknown. An integrated approach, including whole-genome sequencing (WGS), targeted ultradeep cancer gene sequencing, and chromosome analyses (FACETS, OncoScan, and FISH), was performed on 79 chRCC patients including 38 metastatic (M-chRCC) cases. We demonstrate that TP53 mutations (58%), PTEN mutations (24%), and imbalanced chromosome duplication (ICD, duplication of \u2265 3 chromosomes) (25%) were enriched in M-chRCC. Reconstruction of the subclonal composition of paired primary-metastatic chRCC tumors supports the role of TP53, PTEN, and ICD in metastatic evolution. Finally, the presence of these 3 genomic features in primary tumors of both The Cancer Genome Atlas kidney chromophobe (KICH) (n = 64) and M-chRCC (n = 35) cohorts was associated with worse survival. In summary, our study provides genomic insights into the metastatic progression of chRCC and identifies TP53 mutations, PTEN mutations, and ICD as high-risk features.",

			"abstract": "Metastasis is a complex biological process that has been difficult to delineate in human colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. A major obstacle in understanding metastatic lineages is the extensive intra-tumor heterogeneity at the primary and metastatic tumor sites. To address this problem, we developed a highly multiplexed single-cell DNA sequencing approach to trace the metastatic lineages of two CRC patients with matched liver metastases. Single-cell copy number or mutational profiling was performed, in addition to bulk exome and targeted deep-sequencing. In the first patient, we observed monoclonal seeding, in which a single clone evolved a large number of mutations prior to migrating to the liver to establish the metastatic tumor. In the second patient, we observed polyclonal seeding, in which two independent clones seeded the metastatic liver tumor after having diverged at different time points from the primary tumor lineage. The single-cell data also revealed an unexpected independent tumor lineage that did not metastasize, and early progenitor clones with the \"first hit\" mutation in ",

In this study of the whole exomes of 2,361 families in the Simons Simplex Collection, we identified 1,248 putative pSNMs in children and 285 de\u00a0novo SNPs in children with detectable parental mosaicism. Ultra-deep amplicon resequencing suggested a validation rate of 51%. Analyses of validated pSNMs revealed that missense/loss-of-function (LoF) pSNMs with a high mutant allele fraction (MAF\u2265 0.2) contributed to ASD diagnoses (P = 0.022, odds ratio [OR] = 5.25), whereas missense/LoF pSNMs with a low MAF (MAF<0.2) contributed to autistic traits in male non-ASD siblings (P = 0.033). LoF pSNMs in parents were less likely to be transmitted to offspring than neutral pSNMs (P = 0.037), and missense/LoF pSNMs in parents with a low MAF were transmitted more to probands than to siblings (P = 0.016, OR = 1.45). We estimated that pSNMs in probands or de\u00a0novo mutations inherited from parental pSNMs increased the risk of ASD by approximately 6%. Adding pSNMs into the transmission and de\u00a0novo association test model revealed 13 new ASD risk genes. These results expand the existing repertoire of genes involved in ASD and shed new light on the contribution of genomic mosaicisms to ASD diagnoses and autistic traits.",

Here, to probe this heterogeneity, we developed an image-guided genomics technique termed spatiotemporal genomic and cellular analysis (SaGA) that allows for precise selection and amplification of living and rare cells. SaGA was used on collectively invading 3D cancer cell packs to create purified leader and follower cell lines. The leader cell cultures are phenotypically stable and highly invasive in contrast to follower cultures, which show phenotypic plasticity over time and minimally invade in a sheet-like pattern. Genomic and molecular interrogation reveals an atypical VEGF-based vasculogenesis signalling that facilitates recruitment of follower cells but not for leader cell motility itself, which instead utilizes focal adhesion kinase-fibronectin signalling. While leader cells provide an escape mechanism for followers, follower cells in turn provide leaders with increased growth and survival. These data support a symbiotic model of collective invasion where phenotypically distinct cell types cooperate to promote their escape.",

Cancer risk prediction relies on our ability to distinguish between which premalignant features will lead to cancer mortality and which are characteristic of inconsequential disease. Here, we review the evolution of cancer from premalignant disease, and discuss the concept that even phenotypically normal cell progenies inherently gain more malignant potential with age.

Currently, treatment decisions are based on one or a few samples per tumour, creating uncertainty on whether alterations found in those samples are actually present in all tumour cells. The probability of classifying clonal versus sub-clonal alterations from multi-region profiling of tumours depends on the earliest phylogenetic branching event during tumour growth. By analysing 181 samples from 10 renal carcinoma and 11 colorectal cancers we demonstrate that the information gain from additional sampling falls onto a simple universal curve. We found that in colorectal cancers, 30% of alterations identified as clonal with one biopsy proved sub-clonal when 8 samples were considered. The probability to overestimate clonal alterations fell below 1% in 7/11 patients with 8 samples per tumour. In renal cell carcinoma, 8 samples reduced the list of clonal alterations by 40% with respect to a single biopsy. The probability to overestimate clonal alterations remained as high as 92% in 7/10 renal cancer patients. Furthermore, treatment was associated with more unbalanced tumour phylogenetic trees, suggesting the need of denser sampling of tumours at relapse.",

With the advent of next-generation sequencing technology, inference of subclonal populations has become one of the focused interests in cancer-associated studies, and is usually based on the assessment of combinations of somatic single-nucleotide variations (SNV), CNA and LOH. However, cancer samples often have several inherent issues, such as contamination of normal stroma, tumor aneuploidy and intra-tumor heterogeneity.

Such intra-tumor heterogeneity is pervasive not only at the genomic level, but also at the transcriptomic, phenotypic, and cellular levels. Given the implications for precision medicine, the accurate quantification of heterogeneity within and between tumors has become a major focus of current research.

Cancer cells have evolved to fine-tune chromosome missegregation rates to balance the acquisition of heterogeneity while preserving favorable genotypes, a dependence that can be exploited for a therapeutic benefit. We discuss how whole-genome doubling events accelerate clonal evolution in a subset of tumors by providing a viable path toward favorable near-triploid karyotypes and present evidence for CIN-induced clonal speciation that can overcome the dependence on truncal initiating events.",

			"abstract": "The mutational heterogeneity observed within tumours poses additional challenges to the development of effective cancer treatments. A thorough understanding of a tumour's subclonal composition and its mutational history is essential to open up the design of treatments tailored to individual patients. Comparative studies on a large number of tumours permit the identification of mutational patterns which may refine forecasts of cancer progression, response to treatment and metastatic potential. The composition of tumours is shaped by evolutionary processes. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing offer the possibility to analyse the evolutionary history and accompanying heterogeneity of tumours at an unprecedented resolution, by sequencing single cells. New computational challenges arise when moving from bulk to single-cell sequencing data, leading to the development of novel modelling frameworks.

However, the tumor suppressive effects of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) expressing 37AA on HCC cells are still unknown. In this study, we successfully constructed a recombinant rAAV expressing 37AA. In vitro and in vivo assays showed that transfection of NT4-37AA/rAAV in HCC cells strongly suppressed cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and up-regulated the cellular expression of p73. NT4-37AA/rAAV transfection markedly slowed Huh-7 xenografted tumor growth in murine. Pretreatment of HCC cells with p73 siRNA abrogated these effects of NT4-37AA/rAAV. Furthermore, we found that expression of p73 was upregulated and the formation of P73/iASSP complex was prevented when 37AA was introduced into HCC cells. Taken together, these results indicate that introduction of 37AA into HCC cells with a rAAV vector may lead to the development of broadly applicable agents for the treatment of HCC, and the mechanism may, at least in part, be associated with the upregulation of p73 expression and reduced level of P73/iASSP complex.",

We evaluated the quality and design of these studies. A total of 22 studies were eligible for systematic review. Among them, 11 studies investigated the prognostic value of ctDNA on disease-free survival (DFS). Seven of 11 studies showed that ctDNA was an independent variable to estimate the probability of DFS by multivariate analyses. Thirteen studies assessed the relationship between ctDNA and overall survival (OS). Eight of 13 studies showed that ctDNA was an independent predictor of worse OS through the use of multivariate analyses. This analysis provides evidence that ctDNA may be a prognostic biomarker, negatively correlated with the survival of patients with colorectal cancer.",

We performed whole-genome sequencing, structural modelling and cytogenetic analyses of 17 different cancer types, including analysis of the structure and function of chromosomes during metaphase of 2,572 dividing cells, and developed a software package called ECdetect to conduct unbiased, integrated ecDNA detection and analysis. Here we show that ecDNA was found in nearly half of human cancers; its frequency varied by tumour type, but it was almost never found in normal cells. Driver oncogenes were amplified most commonly in ecDNA, thereby increasing transcript level. Mathematical modelling predicted that ecDNA amplification would increase oncogene copy number and intratumoural heterogeneity more effectively than chromosomal amplification. We validated these predictions by quantitative analyses of cancer samples. The results presented here suggest that ecDNA contributes to accelerated evolution in cancer.",

For the first time, we investigated the cancer genome landscape of AOM/DSS mouse model by exome sequencing, to testify its molecular faithfulness to human CRC. Of 14 neoplastic samples, 7575 somatic variants were identified, which resulted in 2507 mutant genes and exhibited a large diversity in both colorectal aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and tumors even those tissues that were gained from the similar morphology or same treatment period. Cross-species comparison of the somatic variants demonstrated the totally different patterns of variable sites, mutant genes and perturbed pathways between mouse and human CRC. We therefore come to a conclusion that the tumorigenesis at genomic level in AOM/DSS model may not be properly comparable with that in human CRC, and the molecular mechanism elicited from this animal model should be carefully evaluated.",

While many studies have focused on the first two components, the role of drift in cancer evolution has received little attention. Drift occurs when all individuals in the population have the same likelihood of producing surviving offspring, and so by definition a drifting population is one that is evolving neutrally. Here we focus on how neutral evolution is manifested in the cancer genome. We discuss how neutral passenger mutations provide a magnifying glass that reveals the evolutionary dynamics underpinning cancer development, and outline how statistical inference can be used to quantify these dynamics from sequencing data. We argue that only after we understand the impact of neutral drift on the genome can we begin to make full sense of clonal selection.

			"abstract": "We live in an era of genomic medicine. The past five\u2005years brought about many significant achievements in the field of cancer genetics, driven by rapidly evolving technologies and plummeting costs of next-generation sequencing (NGS). The official completion of the Cancer Genome Project in 2014 led many to envision the clinical implementation of cancer genomic data as the next logical step in cancer therapy. Stemming from this vision, the term 'precision oncology' was coined to illustrate the novelty of this individualised approach. The basic assumption of precision oncology is that molecular markers detected by NGS will predict response to targeted therapies independently from tumour histology. However, along with a ubiquitous availability of NGS, the complexity and heterogeneity at the individual patient level had to be acknowledged. Not only does the latter present challenges to clinical decision-making based on sequencing data, it is also an obstacle to the rational design of clinical trials. Novel tissue-agnostic trial designs were quickly developed to overcome these challenges. Results from some of these trials have recently demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of this approach. On the other hand, there is an increasing amount of whole-exome and whole-genome NGS data which allows us to assess ever smaller differences between individual patients with cancer. In this review, we highlight different tumour sequencing strategies currently used for precision oncology, describe their individual strengths and weaknesses, and emphasise their feasibility in different clinical settings. Further, we evaluate the possibility of NGS implementation in current and future clinical trials, and point to the significance of NGS for translational research.",

This has the important implication of the widespread existence of cooperative genomic alterations in the accumulation process. Here, we proposed a computational method HCOC that simultaneously consider genetic context and downstream functional effects on cancer hallmarks to uncover somatic cooperative events in human cancers. Applying our method to 12 TCGA cancer types, we totally identified 1199 cooperative events with high heterogeneity across human cancers, and then constructed a pan-cancer cooperative alteration network. These cooperative events are associated with genomic alterations of some high-confident cancer drivers, and can trigger the dysfunction of hallmark associated pathways in a co-defect way rather than single alterations. We found that these cooperative events can be used to produce a prognostic classification that can provide complementary information with tissue-of-origin. In a further case study of glioblastoma, using 23 cooperative events identified, we stratified patients into molecularly relevant subtypes with a prognostic significance independent of the Glioma-CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (GCIMP). In summary, our method can be effectively used to discover cancer-driving cooperative events that can be valuable clinical markers for patient stratification.",

			"abstract": "Tumor heterogeneity, encompassing genetic, epigenetic, and microenvironmental variables, is extremely complex and presents challenges to cancer diagnosis and therapy. Genomic efforts on genetic intratumor heterogeneity (G-ITH) confirm branched evolution, support the trunk-branch cancer model, and present a seemingly insurmountable obstacle to conquering cancers. G-ITH is conspicuous in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), where its presence complicates identification and validation of biomarkers and thwarts efforts in advancing precision cancer therapeutics. However, long-term clinical benefits on targeted therapy are not uncommon in metastatic ccRCC patients, implicating that there are underlying constraints during ccRCC evolution, which in turn force a nonrandom sequence of parallel gene/pathway/function/phenotype convergence within individual tumors. Accordingly, we proposed a \"braided cancer river model\" depicting ccRCC evolution, which deduces cancer development based on multiregion tumor genomics of exceptional mTOR inhibitor (mTORi) responders. Furthermore, we employ an outlier case to explore the river model and highlight the importance of \"Five NGS Matters: Number, Frequency, Position, Site and Time\" in assessing cancer genomics for precision medicine. This mutable cancer river model may capture clinically significant phenotype-convergent events, predict vulnerability/resistance mechanisms, and guide effective therapeutic strategies. Our model originates from studying exceptional responders in ccRCC, which warrants further refinement and future validation concerning its applicability to other cancer types. The goal of this review is employing kidney cancer as an example to illustrate critical issues concerning tumor heterogeneity.",

			"abstract": "Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell growth, and the cause of different cancers is generally attributed to checkpoint dysregulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Recent studies have shown that non-optimal codons were preferentially adopted by genes to generate cell cycle-dependent oscillations in protein levels. This raises the intriguing question of how dynamic changes of codon usage modulate the cancer genome to cope with a non-controlled proliferative cell cycle. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the somatic mutations of codons in human cancers, and found that non-optimal codons tended to be accumulated through both synonymous and non-synonymous mutations compared with other types of genomic substitution. We further demonstrated that non-optimal codons were prevalently accumulated across different types of cancers, amino acids, and chromosomes, and genes with accumulation of non-optimal codons tended to be involved in protein interaction/signaling networks and encoded important enzymes in metabolic networks that played roles in cancer-related pathways. This study provides insights into the dynamics of codons in the cancer genome and demonstrates that accumulation of non-optimal codons may be an adaptive strategy for cancerous cells to win the competition with normal cells. This deeper interpretation of the patterns and the functional characterization of somatic mutations of codons will help to broaden the current understanding of the molecular basis of cancers.",

The full potential of these agents has not, however, been realised, owing to the presence of de novo (intrinsic) resistance, often resulting from compensatory signalling pathways, or the development of acquired resistance in cancer cells via clonal evolution under the selective pressures of treatment. Combinations of targeted treatments can circumvent some mechanisms of resistance to yield a clinical benefit. We explore the challenges in identifying the best drug combinations and the best combination strategies, as well as the complexities of delivering these treatments to patients. Recognizing treatment-induced toxicity and the inability to use continuous pharmacodynamically effective doses of many targeted treatments necessitates creative intermittent scheduling. Serial tumour profiling and the use of parallel co-clinical trials can contribute to understanding mechanisms of resistance, and will guide the development of adaptive clinical trial designs that can accommodate hypothesis testing, in order to realize the full potential of combination therapies.",

To better understand how GBM evolves, we analyzed longitudinal genomic and transcriptomic data from 114 patients. The analysis shows a highly branched evolutionary pattern in which 63% of patients experience expression-based subtype changes. The branching pattern, together with estimates of evolutionary rate, suggests that relapse-associated clones typically existed years before diagnosis. Fifteen percent of tumors present hypermutation at relapse in highly expressed genes, with a clear mutational signature. We find that 11% of recurrence tumors harbor mutations in LTBP4, which encodes a protein binding to TGF-\u03b2. Silencing LTBP4 in GBM cells leads to suppression of TGF-\u03b2 activity and decreased cell proliferation. In recurrent GBM with wild-type IDH1, high LTBP4 expression is associated with worse prognosis, highlighting the TGF-\u03b2 pathway as a potential therapeutic target in GBM.",

In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing of three microsatellite stable (MSS) and two microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) gastric adenomas with three regional tumor biopsies per case. We observed that the mutation abundance of benign gastric adenomas was comparable to those of gastric adenocarcinomas, suggesting that the mutational makeup for gastric carcinogenesis may already be achieved in benign adenomas. The extent of intratumoral heterogeneity was more substantial for MSS genomes in that only 1% - 14% of somatic mutations were common across the regional biopsies or 'public', while 50% - 94% of mutations were public in MSI-H gastric adenomas. We observed biallelic, loss-of-functional events of APC with truncating mutations and/or 5q losses for all cases, mostly as public events. All MSS gastric adenomas also harbored ARID2 truncating mutations, often as multiple, region-specific ones indicative of convergent evolution. Hotspot missense mutations on known cancer genes such as ERBB2 and KRAS were largely observed as region-specific aberrations. These findings suggest that biallelic functional APC inactivation initiates the gastric carcinogenesis and is followed by mutations of histone modifiers and then activation of known cancer-related genes. As the first exome-wide multi-region mutational profiling of gastric adenomas, our study provides clues on the chronological sequence of somatic mutations and their clonal architectures in early gastric carcinogenesis.",

Recent genome sequencing studies have led to the identification of novel phenomena called chromothripsis and chromoanasynthesis in which complex genomic rearrangements are thought to be derived from a single catastrophic event rather than by several incremental steps. A new term chromoanagenesis or chromosomal rebirth was coined recently to group these two one-step catastrophic events together. These phenomena suggest an evolutionary modality for cancer cells to circumvent individual mutational events with one simultaneous shattering of chromosomes resulting in the random reassembling of segmented genetic material to form complex derivative chromosomes. We report a case of possible chromoanagenesis in a patient with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Chromosome analysis from the biopsy showed a complex karyotype with multiple numerical and structural rearrangements including a translocation of chromosomes 3 and 7 involving the BCL6 gene region, with the derivative chromosome further rearranging with chromosomes 14, 7, and 22 with involvement of the IGH gene region. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies confirmed these findings. Chromosomal microarray studies showed multiple complex copy number variations including a chromosome 12 abnormality, the complexity of which appears to suggest the phenomenon of chromoanagenesis. Our case further illustrates that lymphomagenesis can be complex and may arise from a catastrophic event resulting in multiple complex chromosome rearrangements.",

The rate of somatic mutations appears to be greatly variable across the genome due to variations in chromatin organization, DNA accessibility and replication timing. However, other variables that may influence the mutation rate locally are unknown, such as a role for DNA-binding proteins, for example. Here we demonstrate that the rate of somatic mutations in melanomas is highly increased at active transcription factor binding sites and nucleosome embedded DNA, compared to their flanking regions. Using recently available excision-repair sequencing (XR-seq) data, we show that the higher mutation rate at these sites is caused by a decrease of the levels of nucleotide excision repair (NER) activity. Our work demonstrates that DNA-bound proteins interfere with the NER machinery, which results in an increased rate of DNA mutations at the protein binding sites. This finding has important implications for our understanding of mutational and DNA repair processes and in the identification of cancer driver mutations.",

Enriched only in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and in ovarian, endometrial, and liver cancers, TDP tumors conjointly exhibit tumor protein p53 (TP53) mutations, disruption of breast cancer 1 (BRCA1), and increased expression of DNA replication genes pointing at rereplication in a defective checkpoint environment as a plausible causal mechanism. The resultant TDs in TDP augment global oncogene expression and disrupt tumor suppressor genes. Importantly, the TDP strongly correlates with cisplatin sensitivity in both TNBC cell lines and primary patient-derived xenografts. We conclude that the TDP is a common cancer chromotype that coordinately alters oncogene/tumor suppressor expression with potential as a marker for chemotherapeutic response.",

			"abstract": "Cancer is a common cause of death worldwide. Despite significant advances in cancer treatments, the morbidity and mortality are still enormous. Tumor heterogeneity, especially intratumoral heterogeneity, is a significant reason underlying difficulties in tumor treatment and failure of a number of current therapeutic modalities, even of molecularly targeted therapies. The development of a virtually noninvasive \"liquid biopsy\" from the blood has been attempted to characterize tumor heterogeneity. This review focuses on cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the bloodstream as a versatile biomarker. ctDNA analysis is an evolving field with many new methods being developed and optimized to be able to successfully extract and analyze ctDNA, which has vast clinical applications. ctDNA has the potential to accurately genotype the tumor and identify personalized genetic and epigenetic alterations of the entire tumor. In addition, ctDNA has the potential to accurately monitor tumor burden and treatment response, while also being able to monitor minimal residual disease, reducing the need for harmful adjuvant chemotherapy and allowing more rapid detection of relapse. There are still many challenges that need to be overcome prior to this biomarker getting wide adoption in the clinical world, including optimization, standardization, and large multicenter trials.",

COSMOS also prioritizes the candidate SVs using strand-specific read-depth information. Performance tests on modeled tumor genomes revealed that COSMOS outperformed existing methods in terms of F-measure. We also applied COSMOS to an experimental mouse cell-based model, in which SVs were induced by genome engineering and gamma-ray irradiation, followed by polymerase chain reaction-based confirmation. The precision of COSMOS was 84.5%, while the next best existing method was 70.4%.

			"abstract": "Since Otto Warburg made the first observation that tumor cells exhibit altered metabolism and bioenergetics in the 1920s, many scientists have tried to further the understanding of tumor bioenergetics. Particularly, in the past decade, the application of the state-of the-art metabolomics and genomics technologies has revealed the remarkable plasticity of tumor metabolism and bioenergetics. Firstly, a wide array of tumor cells have been shown to be able to use not only glucose, but also glutamine for generating cellular energy, reducing power, and metabolic building blocks for biosynthesis. Secondly, many types of cancer cells generate most of their cellular energy via mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation. Glutamine is the preferred substrate for oxidative phosphorylation in tumor cells. Thirdly, tumor cells exhibit remarkable versatility in using bioenergetics substrates. Notably, tumor cells can use metabolic substrates donated by stromal cells for cellular energy generation via oxidative phosphorylation. Further, it has been shown that mitochondrial transfer is a critical mechanism for tumor cells with defective mitochondria to restore oxidative phosphorylation. The restoration is necessary for tumor cells to gain tumorigenic and metastatic potential. It is also worth noting that heme is essential for the biogenesis and proper functioning of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. Hence, it is not surprising that recent experimental data showed that heme flux and function are elevated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and that elevated heme function promotes intensified oxygen consumption, thereby fueling tumor cell proliferation and function. Finally, emerging evidence increasingly suggests that clonal evolution and tumor genetic heterogeneity contribute to bioenergetic versatility of tumor cells, as well as tumor recurrence and drug resistance. Although mutations are found only in several metabolic enzymes in tumors, diverse mutations in signaling pathways and networks can cause changes in the expression and activity of metabolic enzymes, which likely enable tumor cells to gain their bioenergetic versatility. A better understanding of tumor bioenergetics should provide a more holistic approach to investigate cancer biology and therapeutics. This review therefore attempts to comprehensively consider and summarize the experimental data supporting our latest view of cancer bioenergetics.",

Recently, the existence of CSCs has been indeed confirmed in a number of works.

Likewise, the problem of potential use of CSCs as therapeutic targets remains unsolved.

Tissue biopsies from a metastatic rib lesion were obtained for sequencing before and after initiating enzalutamide treatment over a twelve-week period and also implanted subcutaneously as well as under the renal capsule in immuno-deficient mice. The genome and transcriptome landscapes of xenografts and the original patient tumor tissues were compared by performing whole exome and transcriptome sequencing of the metastatic tumor tissues and the xenografts at both time points. After comparing the somatic mutations, copy number variations, gene fusions and gene expression we found that the patient's genomic and transcriptomic alterations were preserved in the patient derived xenografts with high fidelity.

Given the current complexity of incorporating external software into a genome analysis infrastructure, a tendency exists to rely on the results from a single tool alone. The quality of the output variant calls is highly variable however, depending on factors such as sequence library quality as well as the choice of short-read aligner, variant caller, and variant caller filtering strategy. Here we present a two-part study first using the high quality 'genome in a bottle' reference set to demonstrate the significant impact the choice of aligner, variant caller, and variant caller filtering strategy has on overall variant call quality and further how certain variant callers outperform others with increased sample contamination, an important consideration when analyzing sequenced cancer samples. This analysis confirms previous work showing that combining variant calls of multiple tools results in the best quality resultant variant set, for either specificity or sensitivity, depending on whether the intersection or union, of all variant calls is used respectively. Second, we analyze a melanoma cell line derived from a control lymphocyte sample to determine whether software choices affect the detection of clinically important melanoma risk-factor variants finding that only one of the three such variants is unanimously detected under all conditions. Finally, we describe a cogent strategy for implementing a clinical variant detection pipeline; a strategy that requires careful software selection, variant caller filtering optimizing, and combined variant calls in order to effectively minimize false negative variants. While implementing such features represents an increase in complexity and computation the results offer indisputable improvements in data quality.",

The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between CNAs, histological diagnosis, oral subsite and aneuploidy in OPMDs/OSCCs. Samples from OPMDs and OSCCs were processed by high-resolution DNA flow cytometry (hr DNA-FCM) to determine the relative nuclear DNA content.

Our study shows that: i) aneuploidy, global genomic imbalance (measured as the total number of CNAs) and specific focal CNAs occur early in the development of oral cancer and become more frequent at later stages; ii) OPMDs limited to tongue (TNG) mucosa display a higher frequency of aneuploidy compared to OPMDs confined to buccal mucosa (BM) as measured by DNA-FCM; iii) TNG OPMDs/OSCCs show peculiar features of CIN compared to BM OPMDs/OSCCs given the preferential association with total broad and specific focal CNA gains.

			"abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary cancer of the liver that is predominant in developing countries and is responsible for nearly 600000 deaths each year worldwide. Similar to many other tumors, the development of HCC must be understood as a multistep process involving the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations in regulatory genes, leading to the activation of oncogenes and the inactivation or loss of tumor suppressor genes. Extensive research over the past decade has identified a number of molecular biomarkers, including aberrant expression of HCC-related genes and microRNAs. The challenge facing HCC research and clinical care at this time is to address the heterogeneity and complexity of these genetic and epigenetic alterations and to use this information to direct rational diagnosis and treatment strategies. The multikinase inhibitor sorafenib was the first molecularly targeted drug for HCC to show some extent of survival benefits in patients with advanced tumors. Although the results obtained using sorafenib support the importance of molecular therapies in the treatment of HCC, there is still room for improvement. In addition, no molecular markers for drug sensitivity, recurrence and prognosis are currently clinically available. In this review, we provide an overview of recently published articles addressing HCC-related genes and microRNAs to update what is currently known regarding genetic and epigenetic aspects of the pathogenesis of HCC and propose novel promising candidates for use as diagnostic and therapeutic targets in HCC.",

			"abstract": "Gastric cancer is in decline in most developed countries; however, it still accounts for a notable fraction of global mortality and morbidity related to cancer. High-throughput methods are rapidly changing our view and understanding of the molecular basis of gastric carcinogenesis. Today, it is widely accepted that the molecular complexity and heterogeneity, both inter- and intra-tumour, of gastric adenocarcinomas present significant obstacles in elucidating specific biomarkers for early detection of the disease. Although genome-wide sequencing and gene expression studies have revealed the intricate nature of the molecular changes that occur in tumour landscapes, the collected data and results are complex and sometimes contradictory. Several aberrant molecules have already been tested in clinical trials, although their diagnostic and prognostic utilities have not been confirmed thus far. The gold standard for the detection of sporadic gastric cancer is still the gastric endoscopy, which is considered invasive. In addition, genome-wide association studies have confirmed that genetic variations are important contributors to increased cancer risk and could participate in the initiation of malignant transformation. This hypothesis could in part explain the late onset of sporadic gastric cancers. The elaborate interplay of polymorphic low penetrance genes and lifestyle and environmental risk factors requires additional research to decipher their relative impacts on tumorigenesis. The purpose of this article is to present details of the molecular heterogeneity of sporadic gastric cancers at the DNA, RNA, and proteome levels and to discuss issues relevant to the translation of basic research data to clinically valuable tools. The focus of this work is the identification of relevant molecular changes that could be detected non-invasively.",

Deep sequencing now allows rapid and cost-effective analysis of entire cancer genomes. Dysregulation of cell growth, cell survival, tissue homeostasis, and immune surveillance have been recognized as hallmarks of cancer. In parallel, diagnostic surgical pathology has been harmonized and consensus diagnostic criteria for cancer classification have been developed by initiatives of the World Health Organization, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, and the Union for International Cancer Control. Pharmaceutical companies developed novel drugs targeting specific molecules in signaling pathways, which has allowed the development of the concept of precision medicine. Now, we are facing a large number of clinical trials which bring together these advances and will explore efficacy of novel treatment regimens. Assessment of the efficacy of a new drug is often coupled with the simultaneous assessment of the capacity of tissue-based biomarkers to predict response of individual patients (companion diagnostics/precision medicine). Patients with histologically similar tumors might respond differently to the same drug.

			"abstract": "Mammalian RAD51 paralogs are implicated in the repair of collapsed replication forks by homologous recombination. However, their physiological roles in replication fork maintenance prior to fork collapse remain obscure. Here, we report on the role of RAD51 paralogs in short-term replicative stress devoid of DSBs. We show that RAD51 paralogs localize to nascent DNA and common fragile sites upon replication fork stalling. Strikingly, RAD51 paralogs deficient cells exhibit elevated levels of 53BP1 nuclear bodies and increased DSB formation, the latter being attributed to extensive degradation of nascent DNA at stalled forks. RAD51C and XRCC3 promote the restart of stalled replication in an ATP hydrolysis dependent manner by disengaging RAD51 and other RAD51 paralogs from the halted forks. Notably, we find that Fanconi anemia (FA)-like disorder and breast and ovarian cancer patient derived mutations of RAD51C fails to protect replication fork, exhibit under-replicated genomic regions and elevated micro-nucleation. Taken together, RAD51 paralogs prevent degradation of stalled forks and promote the restart of halted replication to avoid replication fork collapse, thereby maintaining genomic integrity and suppressing tumorigenesis.",

			"abstract": "Our understanding of cancer is being transformed by exploring clonal diversity, drug resistance, and causation within an evolutionary framework. The therapeutic resilience of advanced cancer is a consequence of its character as a complex, dynamic, and adaptive ecosystem engendering robustness, underpinned by genetic diversity and epigenetic plasticity. The risk of mutation-driven escape by self-renewing cells is intrinsic to multicellularity but is countered by multiple restraints, facilitating increasing complexity and longevity of species. But our own species has disrupted this historical narrative by rapidly escalating intrinsic risk. Evolutionary principles illuminate these challenges and provide new avenues to explore for more effective control.",

			"abstract": "Genetic mutation has served as the biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). However, intra-tumor heterogeneity may interfere with personalized treatment strategies based on mutation analysis. This study aimed to characterize somatic mutation profiling of GBM. We collected 33 samples from 7 patients with the primary GBM associated with different Choline (Cho) to N-acetylaspartate (NAA) index (CNI) through the frameless proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) guided biopsies and investigated multiple somatic mutations profiling using the AmpliSeq cancer hotspot panel V2. We identified 53 missense or nonsense mutations in 27 genes including some novel mutations such as APC and IDH2. The mutations in EGFR, TP53, PTEN, PIK3CA genes were presented with different frequency and the majority of the mutated gene was only shared by 1-2 samples from one patient. Moreover, we found the association of CNI with histological grade, but there was no significant change of CNI in the presence of TP53, EGFR and PTEN mutations. These data suggest that gene mutations constitute a heterogeneous marker for primary GBM which may be independent of intra-tumor morphological phenotypes of GBM; therefore, gene mutation markers could not be determined from a small number of needle biopsies or only confined to the high-grade region.",

			"abstract": "Based on the findings of modern molecular biology, breast cancer is nowadays considered to be a heterogeneous disease. This leads to the objective of an individualised, more patient-oriented therapy. A series of target molecules for this purpose has already been identified. The principle of targeted oncological therapy was realised decades ago with the introduction of endocrine therapy for patients with hormone receptor-positive tumours. The modern therapy for HER2-positive tumours is a further example for the translation of targeted therapy into clinical routine. For patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, to date two targeted drugs, bevacizumab and everolimus, are available for routine clinical use. Many other substances are still undergoing clinical development. However, validated predictive markers to aid in therapeutic decision-making and therapy control are still lacking. Chemotherapy constitutes an effective palliative therapy with proven efficacy for the patients. In this process strategies have also been realised for a targeted therapy against tumour cells with the help of chemotherapeutic agents such as, for example, the intracellular activation of the prodrug capecitabine or the active albumin-mediated transport of nab-paclitaxel which leads to higher peri- and intratumoural enrichments. The continuing unchanged relevance of chemotherapy is often underestimated in the current discussions and will be comprehensively evaluated in this review.",

			"abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma (CC) encompasses a group of related but distinct malignancies whose lack of a stereotyped genetic signature makes challenging the identification of genomic landscape and the development of effective targeted therapies. Accumulated evidences strongly suggest that the remarkable genetic heterogeneity of CC may be the result of a complex interplay among different causative factors, some shared by most human cancers while others typical of this malignancy. Currently, considerable efforts are ongoing worldwide for the genetic characterization of CC, also using advanced technologies such as next-generation sequencing (NGS). Undoubtedly this technology could offer an unique opportunity to broaden our understanding on CC molecular pathogenesis. Despite this great potential, however, the high complexity in terms of factors potentially contributing to genetic variability in CC calls for a more cautionary application of NGS to this malignancy, in order to avoid possible biases and criticisms in the identification of candidate actionable targets. This approach is further justified by the urgent need to develop effective targeted therapies in this disease. A multidisciplinary approach integrating genomic, functional and clinical studies is therefore mandatory to translate the results obtained by NGS into effective targeted therapies for this orphan disease.",

			"abstract": "Recent advances in single-cell genomics are opening up unprecedented opportunities to transform cancer genomics. While bulk tissue genomic analysis across large populations of tumour cells has provided key insights into cancer biology, this approach does not provide the resolution that is critical for understanding the interaction between different genetic events within the cellular hierarchy of the tumour during disease initiation, evolution, relapse and metastasis. Single-cell genomic approaches are uniquely placed to definitively unravel complex clonal structures and tissue hierarchies, account for spatiotemporal cell interactions and discover rare cells that drive metastatic disease, drug resistance and disease progression. Here we present five challenges that need to be met for single-cell genomics to fulfil its potential as a routine tool alongside bulk sequencing. These might be thought of as being challenges related to samples (processing and scale for analysis), sensitivity and specificity of mutation detection, sources of heterogeneity (biological and technical), synergies (from data integration) and systems modelling. We discuss these in the context of recent advances in technologies and data modelling, concluding with implications for moving cancer research into the clinic.",

			"abstract": "Lifestyle factors are responsible for a considerable portion of cancer incidence worldwide, but credible estimates from the World Health Organization and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) suggest that the fraction of cancers attributable to toxic environmental exposures is between 7% and 19%. To explore the hypothesis that low-dose exposures to mixtures of chemicals in the environment may be combining to contribute to environmental carcinogenesis, we reviewed 11 hallmark phenotypes of cancer, multiple priority target sites for disruption in each area and prototypical chemical disruptors for all targets, this included dose-response characterizations, evidence of low-dose effects and cross-hallmark effects for all targets and chemicals. In total, 85 examples of chemicals were reviewed for actions on key pathways/mechanisms related to carcinogenesis. Only 15% (13/85) were found to have evidence of a dose-response threshold, whereas 59% (50/85) exerted low-dose effects. No dose-response information was found for the remaining 26% (22/85). Our analysis suggests that the cumulative effects of individual (non-carcinogenic) chemicals acting on different pathways, and a variety of related systems, organs, tissues and cells could plausibly conspire to produce carcinogenic synergies. Additional basic research on carcinogenesis and research focused on low-dose effects of chemical mixtures needs to be rigorously pursued before the merits of this hypothesis can be further advanced. However, the structure of the World Health Organization International Programme on Chemical Safety 'Mode of Action' framework should be revisited as it has inherent weaknesses that are not fully aligned with our current understanding of cancer biology.",

Chromothripsis is characterized by extensive genomic rearrangements and an oscillating pattern of DNA copy number levels, all curiously restricted to one or a few chromosomes. The mechanism for chromothripsis is unknown, but we previously proposed that it could occur through the physical isolation of chromosomes in aberrant nuclear structures called micronuclei. Here, using a combination of live cell imaging and single-cell genome sequencing, we demonstrate that micronucleus formation can indeed generate a spectrum of genomic rearrangements, some of which recapitulate all known features of chromothripsis. These events are restricted to the mis-segregated chromosome and occur within one cell division. We demonstrate that the mechanism for chromothripsis can involve the fragmentation and subsequent reassembly of a single chromatid from a micronucleus. Collectively, these experiments establish a new mutational process of which chromothripsis is one extreme outcome.",

We exome sequenced 40 tumor regions from 8 patients with operable esophageal adenocarcinomas, before and after platinum-containing NAC. This revealed the evolutionary genomic landscape of esophageal adenocarcinomas with the presence of heterogeneous driver mutations, parallel evolution, early genome-doubling events, and an association between high intratumor heterogeneity and poor response to NAC. Multiregion sequencing demonstrated a significant reduction in thymine to guanine mutations within a CpTpT context when comparing early and late mutational processes and the presence of a platinum signature with enrichment of cytosine to adenine mutations within a CpC context following NAC. Esophageal adenocarcinomas are characterized by early chromosomal instability leading to amplifications containing targetable oncogenes persisting through chemotherapy, providing a rationale for future therapeutic approaches.",

Results of high-throughput molecular profiling studies have subsequently revealed the true extent of this heterogeneity. Further complicating this scenario, the heterogeneous expression of the oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 has been reported in different areas of the same tumour. Furthermore, discordance, in terms of ER, PR and HER2 expression, has also been reported between primary tumours and their matched metastatic lesions. High-throughput molecular profiling studies have confirmed that spatial and temporal intratumour heterogeneity of breast cancers exist at a level beyond common expectations. We describe the different levels of tumour heterogeneity, and discuss the strategies that can be adopted by clinicians to tackle treatment response and resistance issues associated with such heterogeneity, including a rationally selected combination of agents that target driver mutations, the targeting of deleterious passenger mutations, identifying and eradicating the 'lethal' clone, targeting the tumour microenvironment, or using adaptive treatments and immunotherapy. The identification of the most-appropriate strategies and their implementation in the clinic will prove highly challenging and necessitate the adoption of radically new practices for the optimal clinical management of breast malignancies.",

Thus, we established the co-clinical trial project, and in doing so developed the concept of the mouse hospital, whereby in vivo preclinical and early clinical studies are closely aligned, enabling in vivo testing of drugs in a multitude of cancer subtypes using mouse models, while minimizing the cost and time required to study responses in thousands of human patients.

			"abstract": "Deciphering whether actionable driver mutations are found in all or a subset of tumor cells will likely be required to improve drug development and precision medicine strategies. We analyzed nine cancer types to determine the subclonal frequencies of driver events, to time mutational processes during cancer evolution, and to identify drivers of subclonal expansions. Although mutations in known driver genes typically occurred early in cancer evolution, we also identified later subclonal \"actionable\" mutations, including BRAF (V600E), IDH1 (R132H), PIK3CA (E545K), EGFR (L858R), and KRAS (G12D), which may compromise the efficacy of targeted therapy approaches. More than 20% of IDH1 mutations in glioblastomas, and 15% of mutations in genes in the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)-AKT-mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling axis across all tumor types were subclonal. Mutations in the RAS-MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase) signaling axis were less likely to be subclonal than mutations in genes associated with PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling. Analysis of late mutations revealed a link between APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis and the acquisition of subclonal driver mutations and uncovered putative cancer genes involved in subclonal expansions, including CTNNA2 and ATXN1. Our results provide a pan-cancer census of driver events within the context of intratumor heterogeneity and reveal patterns of tumor evolution across cancers. The frequent presence of subclonal driver mutations suggests the need to stratify targeted therapy response according to the proportion of tumor cells in which the driver is identified.",

			"abstract": "Genome-wide analysis at the level of single cells has recently emerged as a powerful tool to dissect genome heterogeneity in cancer, neurobiology, and development. To be truly transformative, single-cell approaches must affordably accommodate large numbers of single cells. This is feasible in the case of copy number variation (CNV), because CNV determination requires only sparse sequence coverage. We have used a combination of bioinformatic and molecular approaches to optimize single-cell DNA amplification and library preparation for highly multiplexed sequencing, yielding a method that can produce genome-wide CNV profiles of up to a hundred individual cells on a single lane of an Illumina HiSeq instrument. We apply the method to human cancer cell lines and biopsied cancer tissue, thereby illustrating its efficiency, reproducibility, and power to reveal underlying genetic heterogeneity and clonal phylogeny. The capacity of the method to facilitate the rapid profiling of hundreds to thousands of single-cell genomes represents a key step in making single-cell profiling an easily accessible tool for studying cell lineage.",

The wrinkly spreader morph of Pseudomonas fluorescens arises repeatedly during experimental evolution. The mutational causes reside exclusively within three pathways. By eliminating these, 13 new mutational pathways were discovered with the newly arising WS types having fitnesses similar to those arising from the commonly passaged routes. Our findings show that parallel genetic evolution is strongly biased by constraints and we reveal the genetic bases. From such knowledge, and in instances where new phenotypes arise via gene activation, we suggest a set of principles: evolution proceeds firstly via pathways subject to negative regulation, then via promoter mutations and gene fusions, and finally via activation by intragenic gain-of-function mutations. These principles inform evolutionary forecasting and have relevance to interpreting the diverse array of mutations associated with clinically identical instances of disease in humans.",

Intriguingly, we find that loss of heterozygosity of 11p15.5 and mutations in RAS pathway genes occur early in the evolutionary history of the PAX-fusion-negative-RMS (PFN-RMS) subtype. We discover several early mutations in non-RAS mutated samples and predict them to be drivers in PFN-RMS including recurrent mutation of PKN1. In contrast, we find that PAX-fusion-positive (PFP) subtype tumors have undergone whole-genome duplication in the late stage of cancer evolutionary history and have acquired fewer mutations and subclones than PFN-RMS. Moreover we predict that the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion event occurs earlier than the whole genome duplication. Our findings provide information critical to the understanding of tumorigenesis of RMS.",

The increasing use of personalized therapy of breast cancer necessitates knowledge of the degree of genomic concordance between different steps of malignant progression as primary tumors often are used as surrogates of systemic disease. Based on exome sequencing we performed copy number profiling and point mutation detection on successive steps of breast cancer progression from one breast cancer patient, including two different regions of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS), primary tumor and an asynchronous metastasis. We identify a remarkable landscape of somatic mutations, retained throughout breast cancer progression and with new mutational events emerging at each step. Our data, contrary to the proposed model of early dissemination of metastatic cells and parallel progression of primary tumors and metastases, provide evidence of linear progression of breast cancer with relatively late dissemination from the primary tumor. The genomic discordance between the different stages of tumor evolution in this patient emphasizes the importance of molecular profiling of metastatic tissue directing molecularly targeted therapy at recurrence.",

			"abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a prototypical heterogeneous brain tumor refractory to conventional therapy. A small residual population of cells escapes surgery and chemoradiation, resulting in a typically fatal tumor recurrence \u223c 7 mo after diagnosis. Understanding the molecular architecture of this residual population is critical for the development of successful therapies. We used whole-genome sequencing and whole-exome sequencing of multiple sectors from primary and paired recurrent GBM tumors to reconstruct the genomic profile of residual, therapy resistant tumor initiating cells. We found that genetic alteration of the p53 pathway is a primary molecular event predictive of a high number of subclonal mutations in glioblastoma. The genomic road leading to recurrence is highly idiosyncratic but can be broadly classified into linear recurrences that share extensive genetic similarity with the primary tumor and can be directly traced to one of its specific sectors, and divergent recurrences that share few genetic alterations with the primary tumor and originate from cells that branched off early during tumorigenesis. Our study provides mechanistic insights into how genetic alterations in primary tumors impact the ensuing evolution of tumor cells and the emergence of subclonal heterogeneity.",

Here we show the emergence of novel high-order amplification structures, with corresponding overexpression of embedded genes, during evolution under favourable growth conditions of severely unfit yeast cells bearing genetically disabled genomes.

How collections of mutations work together within a cell and whether there is selection for certain combinations of mutations are not well understood.

Modeling and subsequent experiments revealed that mutations of the tumor suppressor gene NF1 can amplify the effects of other Ras pathway mutations, including weakly activating, noncanonical Ras mutants. Furthermore, analyzing recently available, large, cancer genomic data sets uncovered increased co-occurrence of NF1 mutations with mutations in other Ras network genes. Overall, these data suggest that combinations of Ras pathway mutations could serve the role of cancer \"driver.\" More generally, this work suggests that mutations that result in network instability may promote cancer in a manner analogous to genomic instability.",

We identify recurrent promoter mutations in several genes but find that TERT mutations are exceptional in showing a strong and genome-wide significant association with increased expression. Detailed analysis of TERT across cancers shows that the strength of this association is highly variable and is strongest in copy number-stable cancers such as thyroid carcinoma. We additionally propose that TERT promoter mutations control expression of the nearby gene CLPTM1L. Our analysis provides a detailed pan-cancer view of TERT transcriptional activation but finds no clear evidence for frequent oncogenic promoter mutations beyond TERT.",

The V617F mutation in the JAK2 non-receptor tyrosine kinase (JAK2V617F) is present as an early somatic event in most patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), and the study of these chronic myeloid malignancies provides an experimentally tractable approach to understanding early tumorigenesis. Introduction of exogenous JAK2V617F impairs replication fork progression and is associated with activation of the intra-S checkpoint, with both effects mediated by phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. Analysis of clonally derived JAK2V617F-positive erythroblasts from MPN patients also demonstrated impaired replication fork progression accompanied by increased levels of replication protein A (RPA)-containing foci. However, the associated intra-S checkpoint response was impaired in erythroblasts from polycythemia vera (PV) patients, but not in those from essential thrombocythemia (ET) patients. Moreover, inhibition of p53 in PV erythroblasts resulted in more gamma-H2Ax (\u03b3-H2Ax)-marked double-stranded breaks compared with in like-treated ET erythroblasts, suggesting the defective intra-S checkpoint function seen in PV increases DNA damage in the context of attenuated p53 signaling. These results demonstrate oncogene-induced impairment of replication fork progression in primary cells from MPN patients, reveal unexpected disease-restricted differences in activation of the intra-S checkpoint, and have potential implications for the clonal evolution of malignancies.",

			"abstract": "The FHIT gene at FRA3B is one of the earliest and most frequently altered genes in the majority of human cancers. It was recently discovered that the FHIT gene is not the most fragile locus in epithelial cells, the cell of origin for most Fhit-negative cancers, eroding support for past claims that deletions at this locus are simply passenger events that are carried along in expanding cancer clones, due to extreme vulnerability to DNA damage rather than to loss of FHIT function. Indeed, recent reports have reconfirmed FHIT as a tumor suppressor gene with roles in apoptosis and prevention of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Other recent works have identified a novel role for the FHIT gene product, Fhit, as a genome \"caretaker.\" Loss of this caretaker function leads to nucleotide imbalance, spontaneous replication stress, and DNA breaks. Because Fhit loss-induced DNA damage is \"checkpoint blind,\" cells accumulate further DNA damage during subsequent cell cycles, accruing global genome instability that could facilitate oncogenic mutation acquisition and expedite clonal expansion. Loss of Fhit activity therefore induces a mutator phenotype. Evidence for FHIT as a mutator gene is discussed in light of these recent investigations of Fhit loss and subsequent genome instability.",

Deep-targeted sequencing data can contain PCR duplicates, inflating perceived read depth.

We demonstrate that retention of PCR duplicate reads can imply clonal evolution when none exists, while their removal effectively controls the false positive rate.

			"abstract": "Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematologic malignancy in the world. Despite improvement in outcome, the disease is still incurable for most patients. However, not all myeloma are the same. With the same treatment, some patients can have very long survival whereas others can have very short survival. This suggests that there is underlying heterogeneity in myeloma. Studies over the years have revealed multiple layers of heterogeneity. First, clinical parameters such as age and tumor burden could significantly affect outcome. At the genetic level, there are also significant heterogeneity ranging for chromosome numbers, genetic translocations, and genetic mutations. At the clonal level, there appears to be significant clonal heterogeneity with multiple clones coexisting in the same patient. At the cell differentiation level, there appears to be a hierarchy of clonally related cells that have different clonogenic potential and sensitivity to therapies. These levels of complexities present challenges in terms of treatment and prognostication as well as monitoring of treatment. However, if we can clearly delineate and dissect this heterogeneity, we may also be presented with unique opportunities for precision and personalized treatment of myeloma. Some proof of concepts of such approaches has been demonstrated.",

Our understanding of molecular events underpinning treatment failure has been enhanced by new genomic technologies and pre-clinical studies. Intratumour genetic heterogeneity (ITH) is a prominent contributor to therapeutic failure, and it is becoming increasingly apparent that individual tumours may achieve resistance via multiple routes simultaneously - termed polyclonal resistance. Efforts to target single resistance mechanisms to overcome therapeutic failure may therefore yield only limited success.

			"abstract": "Tumor evolution presents a formidable obstacle that currently prevents the development of truly curative treatments for cancer. In this perspective, we advocate for the hypothesis that tumor cells with significantly elevated genomic content (polyploid tumor cells) facilitate rapid tumor evolution and the acquisition of therapy resistance in multiple incurable cancers. We appeal to studies conducted in yeast, cancer models, and cancer patients, which all converge on the hypothesis that polyploidy enables large phenotypic leaps, providing access to many different therapy-resistant phenotypes. We develop a flow-cytometry based method for quantifying the prevalence of polyploid tumor cells, and show the frequency of these cells in patient tumors may be higher than is generally appreciated. We then present recent studies identifying promising new therapeutic strategies that could be used to specifically target polyploid tumor cells in cancer patients. We argue that these therapeutic approaches should be incorporated into new treatment strategies aimed at blocking tumor evolution by killing the highly evolvable, therapy-resistant polyploid cell subpopulations, thus helping to maintain patient tumors in a drug sensitive state.",

			"abstract": "Glioblastomas (GBM) with EGFR amplification represent approximately 50% of newly diagnosed cases, and recent studies have revealed frequent coexistence of multiple EGFR aberrations within the same tumor, which has implications for mutation cooperation and treatment resistance. However, bulk tumor sequencing studies cannot resolve the patterns of how the multiple EGFR aberrations coexist with other mutations within single tumor cells. Here, we applied a population-based single-cell whole-genome sequencing methodology to characterize genomic heterogeneity in EGFR-amplified glioblastomas. Our analysis effectively identified clonal events, including a novel translocation of a super enhancer to the TERT promoter, as well as subclonal LOH and multiple EGFR mutational variants within tumors. Correlating the EGFR mutations onto the cellular hierarchy revealed that EGFR truncation variants (EGFRvII and EGFR carboxyl-terminal deletions) identified in the bulk tumor segregate into nonoverlapping subclonal populations. In vitro and in vivo functional studies show that EGFRvII is oncogenic and sensitive to EGFR inhibitors currently in clinical trials. Thus, the association between diverse activating mutations in EGFR and other subclonal mutations within a single tumor supports an intrinsic mechanism for proliferative and clonal diversification with broad implications in resistance to treatment.",

This article makes an attempt to put together the information, methods, and technologies that relate to health outcomes from biological, behavioral, and social disciplines. Much of this information was obtained by controlling for the variations of the factors in 'other' disciplines. For example, genetic factors were controlled for in identifying the behavioral determinants of health. Looking forward, better understandings of health outcomes may require exploiting the interactions of health determinants that were identified from different disciplines. We propose the concept of 'systems health' studies, which take health outcomes as the outputs of a system, where the inputs and their interactions from multiple disciplines are considered.",

			"abstract": "Two mutant forms (R132H and R132C) of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) have been associated with a number of cancers including glioblastoma and acute myeloid leukemia. These mutations confer a neomorphic activity of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) production, and 2-HG has previously been implicated as an oncometabolite. Inhibitors of mutant IDH1 can potentially be used to treat these diseases. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of action of a newly discovered inhibitor, ML309, using biochemical, cellular, and biophysical approaches. Substrate binding and product inhibition studies helped to further elucidate the IDH1 R132H catalytic cycle. This rapidly equilibrating inhibitor is active in both biochemical and cellular assays. The (+) isomer is active (IC50 = 68 nm), whereas the (-) isomer is over 400-fold less active (IC50 = 29 \u03bcm) for IDH1 R132H inhibition. IDH1 R132C was similarly inhibited by (+)-ML309. WT IDH1 was largely unaffected by (+)-ML309 (IC50 >36 \u03bcm). Kinetic analyses combined with microscale thermophoresis and surface plasmon resonance indicate that this reversible inhibitor binds to IDH1 R132H competitively with respect to \u03b1-ketoglutarate and uncompetitively with respect to NADPH. A reaction scheme for IDH1 R132H inhibition by ML309 is proposed in which ML309 binds to IDH1 R132H after formation of the IDH1 R132H NADPH complex. ML309 was also able to inhibit 2-HG production in a glioblastoma cell line (IC50 = 250 nm) and had minimal cytotoxicity. In the presence of racemic ML309, 2-HG levels drop rapidly. This drop was sustained until 48 h, at which point the compound was washed out and 2-HG levels recovered.",

			"abstract": "The development of noninvasive methods to detect and monitor tumors continues to be a major challenge in oncology. We used digital polymerase chain reaction-based technologies to evaluate the ability of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to detect tumors in 640 patients with various cancer types. We found that ctDNA was detectable in >75% of patients with advanced pancreatic, ovarian, colorectal, bladder, gastroesophageal, breast, melanoma, hepatocellular, and head and neck cancers, but in less than 50% of primary brain, renal, prostate, or thyroid cancers. In patients with localized tumors, ctDNA was detected in 73, 57, 48, and 50% of patients with colorectal cancer, gastroesophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and breast adenocarcinoma, respectively. ctDNA was often present in patients without detectable circulating tumor cells, suggesting that these two biomarkers are distinct entities. In a separate panel of 206 patients with metastatic colorectal cancers, we showed that the sensitivity of ctDNA for detection of clinically relevant KRAS gene mutations was 87.2% and its specificity was 99.2%. Finally, we assessed whether ctDNA could provide clues into the mechanisms underlying resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor blockade in 24 patients who objectively responded to therapy but subsequently relapsed. Twenty-three (96%) of these patients developed one or more mutations in genes involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Together, these data suggest that ctDNA is a broadly applicable, sensitive, and specific biomarker that can be used for a variety of clinical and research purposes in patients with multiple different types of cancer.",

			"abstract": "In acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), the cell of origin, nature and biological consequences of initiating lesions, and order of subsequent mutations remain poorly understood, as AML is typically diagnosed without observation of a pre-leukaemic phase. Here, highly purified haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), progenitor and mature cell fractions from the blood of AML patients were found to contain recurrent DNMT3A mutations (DNMT3A(mut)) at high allele frequency, but without coincident NPM1 mutations (NPM1c) present in AML blasts. DNMT3A(mut)-bearing HSCs showed a multilineage repopulation advantage over non-mutated HSCs in xenografts, establishing their identity as pre-leukaemic HSCs. Pre-leukaemic HSCs were found in remission samples, indicating that they survive chemotherapy. Therefore DNMT3A(mut) arises early in AML evolution, probably in HSCs, leading to a clonally expanded pool of pre-leukaemic HSCs from which AML evolves. Our findings provide a paradigm for the detection and treatment of pre-leukaemic clones before the acquisition of additional genetic lesions engenders greater therapeutic resistance.",

			"abstract": "Although many DNA aberrations in melanoma have been well characterized, including focal amplification and deletions of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, broad regions of chromosomal gain and loss are less well understood. One possibility is that these broad events are a consequence of collateral damage from targeting single loci. Another possibility is that the loss of large regions permits the simultaneous repression of multiple tumor suppressors by broadly decreasing the resident gene dosage and expression. Here, we test this hypothesis in a targeted fashion using RNA interference to suppress multiple candidate residents in broad regions of loss. We find that loss of chromosome regions 6q, 10, and 11q21-ter is correlated with broadly decreased expression of most resident genes and that multiple resident genes impacted by broad regional loss of chromosome 10 are tumor suppressors capable of affecting tumor growth and/or invasion. We also provide additional functional support for Ablim1 as a novel tumor suppressor. Our results support the hypothesis that multiple cancer genes are targeted by regional chromosome copy number aberrations.",

			"abstract": "Multiple subclonal populations of tumor cells can coexist within the same tumor. This intra-tumor heterogeneity will have clinical implications and it is therefore important to identify factors that drive or suppress such heterogeneous tumor progression. Evolutionary biology can provide important insights into this process. In particular, experimental evolution studies of microbial populations, which exist as clonal populations that can diversify into multiple subclones, have revealed important evolutionary processes driving heterogeneity within a population. There are transferrable lessons that can be learnt from these studies that will help us to understand the process of intra-tumor heterogeneity in the clinical setting. In this review, we summarize drivers of microbial diversity that have been identified, such as mutation rate and environmental influences, and discuss how knowledge gained from microbial experimental evolution studies may guide us to identify and understand important selective factors that promote intra-tumor heterogeneity. Furthermore, we discuss how these factors could be used to direct and optimize research efforts to improve patient care, focusing on therapeutic resistance. Finally, we emphasize the need for longitudinal studies to address the impact of these potential tumor heterogeneity-promoting factors on drug resistance, metastatic potential and clinical outcome.",

			"abstract": "Recent reports indicate that inactivation of the RB, TP53 or PTEN tumour suppressor genes is detected in tumour stroma of oropharyngeal, breast and other human cancers. Mouse models have validated the tumour-promoting effects of deleting Rb, Pten or p53 in fibroblasts that converts them from normal fibroblasts to carcinoma associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The tumour-promoting activity of CAFs in these contexts was associated with increased paracrine signaling to tumour cells through production of specific growth factors, chemokines and MMPs by CAFs. The conversion of NOFs into CAFs through acquisition of specific mutations, such as loss of tumour suppressors, or deregulated expression of microRNAs or key epigenetic events, can clearly occur independently of genetic and epigenetic changes in tumour cells but an alternative source of CAFs that is being reconsidered is that CAFs derive from the tumour cells by EMT. Recent mouse models employing lineage-tracing techniques have suggested that this can take place in vivo and the extent to which this is relevant more broadly is discussed.",

			"abstract": "Intra-tumor heterogeneity is a hallmark of many cancers and may lead to therapy resistance or interfere with personalized treatment strategies. Here, we combined topographic mapping of somatic breakpoints and transcriptional profiling to probe intra-tumor heterogeneity of treatment-na\u00efve stage IIIC/IV epithelial ovarian cancer. We observed that most substantial differences in genomic rearrangement landscapes occurred between metastases in the omentum and peritoneum versus tumor sites in the ovaries. Several cancer genes such as NF1, CDKN2A, and FANCD2 were affected by lesion-specific breakpoints. Furthermore, the intra-tumor variability involved different mutational hallmarks including lesion-specific kataegis (local mutation shower coinciding with genomic breakpoints), rearrangement classes, and coding mutations. In one extreme case, we identified two independent TP53 mutations in ovary tumors and omentum/peritoneum metastases, respectively. Examination of gene expression dynamics revealed up-regulation of key cancer pathways including WNT, integrin, chemokine, and Hedgehog signaling in only subsets of tumor samples from the same patient. Finally, we took advantage of the multilevel tumor analysis to understand the effects of genomic breakpoints on qualitative and quantitative gene expression changes. We show that intra-tumor gene expression differences are caused by site-specific genomic alterations, including formation of in-frame fusion genes. These data highlight the plasticity of ovarian cancer genomes, which may contribute to their strong capacity to adapt to changing environmental conditions and give rise to the high rate of recurrent disease following standard treatment regimes.",

			"abstract": "In this proof-of-principle study, we sought to define whether targeted capture massively parallel sequencing can be employed to determine the origin of metastatic deposits in cases of synchronous primary malignancies and metastases in distinct anatomical sites. DNA samples extracted from synchronous tumor masses in the breast, adnexal, and pelvic-peritoneal regions from a 62-year-old BRCA1 germline mutation carrier were subjected to targeted massively parallel sequencing using a platform comprising 300 cancer genes known to harbor actionable mutations. In addition to BRCA1 germline mutations, all lesions harbored somatic loss of the BRCA1 wild-type allele and TP53 somatic mutations. The primary breast cancer displayed a TP53 frameshift (p.Q317fs) mutation, whereas and the adnexal lesion harbored a TP53 nonsense (p.R213*) mutation, consistent with a diagnosis of two independent primary tumors (i.e. breast and ovarian cancer). The adnexal tumor and all pelvic-peritoneal implants harbored identical TP53 (p.R213*) and NCOA2 (p.G952R) somatic mutations. Evidence of genetic heterogeneity within and between lesions was observed, both in terms of somatic mutations and copy number aberrations. The repertoires of somatic genetic aberrations found in the breast, ovarian, and pelvic-peritoneal lesions provided direct evidence in support of the distinct origin of the breast and ovarian cancers, and established that the pelvic-peritoneal implants were clonally related to the ovarian lesion. These observations were consistent with those obtained with immunohistochemical analyses employing markers to differentiate between carcinomas of the breast and ovary, including WT1 and PAX8. Our results on this case of a patient with BRCA1-mutant breast and ovarian cancer demonstrate that massively parallel sequencing may constitute a useful tool to define the relationship, clonality and intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity between primary tumor masses and their metastatic deposits in patients with multiple primary malignancies and synchronous metastases.",

Here, we used expression profiling to identify new components of the machinery for sorting proteins into mucocysts, secretory granule-like vesicles in the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila. We show that assembly of mucocysts depends on proteins classically associated with lysosome biogenesis. In particular, the delivery of nonaggregated, but not aggregated, cargo proteins requires classical receptors of the sortilin/VPS10 family, which indicates that dual mechanisms are involved in sorting to this secretory compartment. In addition, sortilins are required for delivery of a key protease involved in T. thermophila mucocyst maturation. Our results suggest potential similarities in the formation of regulated secretory organelles between even very distantly related eukaryotes.",

The complexity and topography of intraclonal genetic architectures have major implications for biopsy-based prognosis and for targeted therapy. High-depth, next-generation sequencing (NGS) efficiently captures the mutational load of individual tumors or biopsies. But, being a snapshot portrait of total DNA, it disguises the fundamental features of subclonal variegation of genetic lesions and of clonal phylogeny. Single-cell genetic profiling provides a potential resolution to this problem, but methods developed to date all have limitations. We present a novel solution to this challenge using leukemic cells with known mutational spectra as a tractable model. DNA from flow-sorted single cells is screened using multiplex targeted Q-PCR within a microfluidic platform allowing unbiased single-cell selection, high-throughput, and comprehensive analysis for all main varieties of genetic abnormalities: chimeric gene fusions, copy number alterations, and single-nucleotide variants. We show, in this proof-of-principle study, that the method has a low error rate and can provide detailed subclonal genetic architectures and phylogenies.",

Fortunately, constraint-based modeling, a systems biology approach, now enables one to study the entirety of cancer metabolism and simulate basic phenotypes. With the newness of this field, there has been a rapid evolution of both the scope of these models and their applications. Here we review the various constraint-based models built for cancer metabolism and how their predictions are shedding new light on basic cancer phenotypes, elucidating pathway differences between tumors, and dicovering putative anti-cancer targets.

			"abstract": "Classifying intracystic papillary carcinoma under invasive or in situ ductal carcinoma is still a matter of debate. The purpose of this study was to explore the genomic relationship of this tumor to its concurrent invasive ductal carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ using array comparative genomic hybridization. Intracystic papillary carcinoma cases were classified into three categories: pure, with concurrent ductal carcinoma in situ or with concurrent invasive ductal carcinoma. Each component was dissected using laser capture microdissection. DNA was extracted and array comparative genomic hybridization was performed. The test of difference in copy number changes among the three tumors was carried out using CGHMultiArray. Intracystic papillary carcinoma clustered with four of five concurrent ductal carcinoma in situ cases and with two of two invasive ductal carcinoma cases. Intracystic papillary carcinoma showed the highest proportions of genome copy number aberration, followed by ductal carcinoma in situ, and then by invasive ductal carcinoma (P=0.06). Comparing intracystic papillary carcinoma with invasive ductal carcinoma vs without invasive ductal carcinoma, the former had 11q22.1-23.3 loss (P=0.031) and chr5 gain (P=0.085), and was enriched with matrix metalloproteinase genes. Comparing intracystic papillary carcinoma with ductal carcinoma in situ vs without ductal carcinoma in situ, the former had gain in 5q35.3 (P=0.041), 8q24.3 (P=0.041) and 21q13.2 to 21q13.31 (P=0.011). Comparing intracystic papillary carcinoma with ductal carcinoma in situ, the latter acquired a group of genes involved in cell adhesion and motility, whereas intracystic papillary carcinoma differentially expressed genes that are involved in papillary carcinomas of other organs (thyroid and kidney). We conclude that the overall molecular change in intracystic papillary carcinoma is closer to ductal carcinoma in situ than to invasive ductal carcinoma, which may explain the indolent behavior of this tumor. We offer herein a proposal of intracystic papillary carcinoma pathogenesis through its relation to invasive ductal carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ.",

We propose an evolutionary framework for deconvolving data from a single genome-wide experiment to infer the composition, abundance and evolutionary paths of the underlying cell subpopulations of a tumor. We have developed an algorithm (TrAp) for solving this mixture problem. In silico analyses show that TrAp correctly deconvolves mixed subpopulations when the number of subpopulations and the measurement errors are moderate. We demonstrate the applicability of the method using tumor karyotypes and somatic hypermutation data sets. We applied TrAp to Exome-Seq experiment of a renal cell carcinoma tumor sample and compared the mutational profile of the inferred subpopulations to the mutational profiles of single cells of the same tumor.

This research also aims to explore the role of adjuvant bisphosphonates, to interrogate new agents for targeting minimal residual disease, and to address endocrine resistance. Data from next-generation sequencing studies have given us new insight into the biology of luminal breast cancer and, together with advances in preclinical models and the availability of newer targeted agents, have led to the testing of rationally chosen combination treatments in clinical trials.

Mutation clusters in whole-genome and exome data sets conformed to the stringent criteria indicative of an APOBEC mutation pattern. Applying these criteria to 954,247 mutations in 2,680 exomes from 14 cancer types, mostly from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), showed a significant presence of the APOBEC mutation pattern in bladder, cervical, breast, head and neck, and lung cancers, reaching 68% of all mutations in some samples. Within breast cancer, the HER2-enriched subtype was clearly enriched for tumors with the APOBEC mutation pattern, suggesting that this type of mutagenesis is functionally linked with cancer development. The APOBEC mutation pattern also extended to cancer-associated genes, implying that ubiquitous APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis is carcinogenic.",

Since complete or severe APE1 deficiency leads to embryonic lethality and cell death, it has been hypothesized that APE1 protein variants with slightly impaired function will contribute to disease etiology. Our data indicate that except for the endometrial cancer-associated APE1 variant R237C, the polymorphic variants Q51H, I64V and D148E, the rare population variants G241R, P311S and A317V, and the tumor-associated variant P112L exhibit normal thermodynamic stability of protein folding; abasic endonuclease, 3'-5' exonuclease and REF-1 activities; coordination during the early steps of base excision repair; and intracellular distribution when expressed exogenously in HeLa cells. The R237C mutant displayed reduced AP-DNA complex stability, 3'-5' exonuclease activity and 3'-damage processing. Re-sequencing of the exonic regions of APE1 uncovered no novel amino acid substitutions in the 60 cancer cell lines of the NCI-60 panel, or in HeLa or T98G cancer cell lines; only the common D148E and Q51H variants were observed.

			"abstract": "Our knowledge of the biology of solid cancer has greatly progressed during the last few years, and many excellent reviews dealing with the various aspects of this biology have appeared. In the present review, we attempt to bring together these subjects in a general systems biology narrative. It starts from the roles of what we term entropy of signaling and noise in the initial oncogenic events, to the first major transition of tumorigenesis: the independence of the tumor cell and the switch in its physiology, i.e., from subservience to the organism to its own independent Darwinian evolution. The development after independence involves a constant dynamic reprogramming of the cells and the emergence of a sort of collective intelligence leading to invasion and metastasis and seldom to the ultimate acquisition of immortality through inter-individual infection. At each step, the probability of success is minimal to infinitesimal, but the number of cells possibly involved and the time scale account for the relatively high occurrence of tumorigenesis and metastasis in multicellular organisms.",

			"abstract": "The mutator phenotype hypothesis proposes that the mutation rate of normal cells is insufficient to account for the large number of mutations found in human cancers. Consequently, human tumors exhibit an elevated mutation rate that increases the likelihood of a tumor acquiring advantageous mutations. The hypothesis predicts that tumors are composed of cells harboring hundreds of thousands of mutations, as opposed to a small number of specific driver mutations, and that malignant cells within a tumor therefore constitute a highly heterogeneous population. As a result, drugs targeting specific mutated driver genes or even pathways of mutated driver genes will have only limited anticancer potential. In addition, because the tumor is composed of such a diverse cell population, tumor cells harboring drug-resistant mutations will exist prior to the administration of any chemotherapeutic agent. We present recent evidence in support of the mutator phenotype hypothesis, major arguments against this concept, and discuss the clinical consequences of tumor evolution fueled by an elevated mutation rate. We also consider the therapeutic possibility of altering the rate of mutation accumulation. Most significantly, we contend that there is a need to fundamentally reconsider current approaches to personalized cancer therapy. We propose that targeting cellular pathways that alter the rate of mutation accumulation in tumors will ultimately prove more effective than attempting to identify and target mutant driver genes or driver pathways.",

The meeting started and closed with three plenary lectures to give common background and to share the final panel discussion and conclusions. The two day event included case studies and networking for nearly 250 delegates who learned of the latest advances and trends in the global development of antibody-based therapeutics. The monoclonal antibody track was focused on understanding the structure-function relationships, optimization of antibody design and developability, and processes that allow better therapeutic candidates to move through the clinic. Discussions on novel target identification and validation were also included. The ADC track was dedicated to evaluation of the ongoing success of the established ADC formats alongside the rise of the next generation drug-conjugates. The bispecific and alternative scaffold track was focused on taking stock of the multitude of bispecific formats being investigated and gaining insight into recent innovations and advancements. Mechanistic understanding, progression into the clinic and the exploration of multispecifics, redirected T cell killing and alternative scaffolds were extensively discussed. In total, nearly 50 speakers provided updates of programs related to antibody research and development on-going in the academic, government and commercial sectors.",

Accumulating evidence suggests that intratumor heterogeneity likely is the key to understanding treatment failure. However, the extent of intratumor heterogeneity as a result of tumor evolution is still poorly understood. To address this, we developed a unique surgical multisampling scheme to collect spatially distinct tumor fragments from 11 GB patients. We present an integrated genomic analysis that uncovers extensive intratumor heterogeneity, with most patients displaying different GB subtypes within the same tumor. Moreover, we reconstructed the phylogeny of the fragments for each patient, identifying copy number alterations in EGFR and CDKN2A/B/p14ARF as early events, and aberrations in PDGFRA and PTEN as later events during cancer progression. We also characterized the clonal organization of each tumor fragment at the single-molecule level, detecting multiple coexisting cell lineages. Our results reveal the genome-wide architecture of intratumor variability in GB across multiple spatial scales and patient-specific patterns of cancer evolution, with consequences for treatment design.",

The so-called 'cancer stem cells' have the essential properties required to function as the key units of selection, particularly with respect to their proliferative potential and longevity.

			"abstract": "The incidence of Barrett's esophagus (BE)-associated esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is increasing. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides an unprecedented opportunity to uncover genomic alterations during BE pathogenesis and progression to EAC, but treatment-naive surgical specimens are scarce. The objective of this study was to establish the feasibility of using widely available endoscopic mucosal biopsies for successful NGS, using samples obtained from a BE 'progressor'. Paired-end whole-genome NGS was performed on the Illumina platform using libraries generated from mucosal biopsies of normal squamous epithelium (NSE), BE and EAC obtained from a patient who progressed to adenocarcinoma during endoscopic surveillance. Selective validation studies, including Sanger sequencing, immunohistochemistry and functional assays, were performed to confirm the NGS findings. NGS identified somatic nonsense mutations of AT-rich interactive domain 1A (SWI like) (ARID1A) and PPIE and an additional 37 missense mutations in BE and/or EAC, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. ARID1A mutations were detected in 15% (3/20) high-grade dysplasia (HGD)/EAC patients. Immunohistochemistry performed on an independent archival cohort demonstrated ARID1A protein loss in 0% (0/76), 4.9% (2/40), 14.3% (4/28), 16.0% (8/50) and 12.2% (12/98) of NSE, BE, low-grade dysplasia, HGD and EAC tissues, respectively, and was inversely associated with nuclear p53 accumulation (P=0.028). Enhanced cell growth, proliferation and invasion were observed on ARID1A knockdown in EAC cells. In addition, genes downstream of ARID1A that potentially contribute to the ARID1A knockdown phenotype were identified. Our studies establish the feasibility of using mucosal biopsies for NGS, which should enable the comparative analysis of larger 'progressor' versus 'non-progressor' cohorts. Further, we identify ARID1A as a novel tumor-suppressor gene in BE pathogenesis, reiterating the importance of aberrant chromatin in the metaplasia-dysplasia sequence.",

We review recent advances surrounding single-cell mitochondrial genome sequencing and its integration with functional genomic readouts, including leveraging somatic mitochondrial DNA mutations as clonal markers that can resolve cellular population dynamics in complex human tissues.

The analysis found a significant variation in strength of selection (both negative and positive) among tumors, with median selection tending to be negative even though tumors with strong positive selection also exist. Strength of selection estimated as the density of missense mutations relative to the density of silent mutations showed only a weak correlation with tumor mutation burden. In the \"all histology together\" analysis we found that absolute strength of selection was strongly correlated with all clinically relevant features analyzed. In histology-stratified analysis selection was strongest in small cell lung cancer. Selection in adenocarcinoma was somewhat higher compared to squamous cell carcinoma. The study suggests that somatic mutation- based quantifying of directional and absolute selection in individual tumors can be a useful biomarker of tumor aggressiveness.",

Understanding the biological differences between IBCs and screen-detected breast-cancers (SDBCs) has the potential to improve mammographic screening and patient management. We analysed and compared the genomic landscape of 288 IBCs and 473 SDBCs by whole genome sequencing of paired tumour-normal patient samples collected as part of the UK 100,000 Genomes Project. Compared to SDBCs, IBCs were more likely to be lobular, higher grade, and triple negative. A more aggressive clinical phenotype was reflected in IBCs displaying features of genomic instability including a higher mutation rate and number of chromosomal structural abnormalities, defective homologous recombination and TP53 mutations. We did not however, find evidence to indicate that IBCs are associated with a significantly different immune response. While IBCs do not represent a unique molecular class of invasive breast cancer they exhibit a more aggressive phenotype, which is likely to be a consequence of the timing of tumour initiation. This information is relevant both with respect to treatment as well as informing the screening interval for mammography.",

			"abstract": "Recent studies have revealed that arginine is the most favorable target of amino acid alteration in most cancer types and it has been suggested that the high preference for arginine mutations reflects the critical roles of this amino acid in the function of proteins. High rates of mutations of arginine residues in cancer, however, might also be due to increased mutability of arginine codons of the CGN family as the CpG dinucleotides of these codons may be methylated. In the present work we have analyzed spectra of single base substitutions of cancer genes (oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes) and passenger genes in cancer tissues to assess the contributions of CpG hypermutability and selection to arginine mutations. Our studies have shown that arginines encoded by the CGN codon family display higher rates of mutation in both cancer genes and passenger genes than arginine codons AGA and AGG that are devoid of CpG dinucleotide, suggesting that the predominance of arginine mutations in cancer is primarily due to CpG hypermutability, rather than selection for arginine replacement. Nevertheless, our results also suggest that CGN codons for arginines may serve as Achilles' heels of cancer genes. CpG hypermutability of key arginines of proto-oncogenes, leading to high rates of recurrence of driver mutations, contributes significantly to carcinogenesis. Similarly, our results indicate that hypermutability of the CpG dinucleotide of CGA codons (converting them to TGA stop codons) contributes significantly to recurrent truncation and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes.",

Here we use spatial approaches to identify genomic, biochemical and cellular mechanisms linking intratumor heterogeneity to the molecular, temporal and spatial evolution of high-grade meningiomas. We show that divergent intratumor gene and protein expression programs distinguish high-grade meningiomas that are otherwise grouped together by current classification systems. Analyses of matched pairs of primary and recurrent meningiomas reveal spatial expansion of subclonal copy number variants associated with treatment resistance. Multiplexed sequential immunofluorescence and deconvolution of meningioma spatial transcriptomes using cell types from single-cell RNA sequencing show decreased immune infiltration, decreased MAPK signaling, increased PI3K-AKT signaling and increased cell proliferation, which are associated with meningioma recurrence. To translate these findings to preclinical models, we use CRISPR interference and lineage tracing approaches to identify combination therapies that target intratumor heterogeneity in meningioma cell co-cultures.",

Previous studies showed age-associated DNA methylation (DNAm) changes in specific genomic regions, termed clock-like differential methylation loci (ClockDML). Age-associated DNAm could either result from or result in chromatin accessibility changes at ClockDML. As cells undergo mitosis, the heterogeneity of chromatin accessibility on clock-like loci is reduced, providing a measure of mitotic age. In this study, we developed a method, called EpiTrace, that counts the fraction of opened clock-like loci from scATAC-seq data to determine cell age and perform lineage tracing in various cell lineages and animal species. It shows concordance with known developmental hierarchies, correlates well with DNAm-based clocks and is complementary with mutation-based lineage tracing, RNA velocity and stemness predictions. Applying EpiTrace to scATAC-seq data reveals biological insights with clinically relevant implications, ranging from hematopoiesis, organ development, tumor biology and immunity to cortical gyrification.",

			"abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by frequent MYC translocations. Sporadic MYC activation in the germinal center of genetically engineered Vk*MYC mice is sufficient to induce plasma cell tumors in which a variety of secondary mutations are spontaneously acquired and selected over time. Analysis of 119 Vk*MYC myeloma reveals recurrent copy number alterations, structural variations, chromothripsis, driver mutations, apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide (APOBEC) mutational activity, and a progressive decrease in immunoglobulin transcription that inversely correlates with proliferation. Moreover, we identify frequent insertional mutagenesis by endogenous retro-elements as a murine specific mechanism to activate NF-kB and IL6 signaling pathways shared with human MM. Despite the increased genomic complexity associated with progression, advanced tumors remain dependent on MYC. In summary, here we credential the Vk*MYC mouse as a unique resource to explore MM genomic evolution and describe a fully annotated collection of diverse and immortalized murine MM tumors.",

			"abstract": "In the past two decades, technological advances have brought unprecedented insights into the paediatric cancer genome revealing characteristics distinct from those of adult cancer. Originating from developing tissues, paediatric cancers generally have low mutation burden and are driven by variants that disrupt the transcriptional activity, chromatin state, non-coding cis-regulatory regions and other biological functions. Within each tumour, there are multiple populations of cells with varying states, and the lineages of some can be tracked to their fetal origins. Genome-wide genetic screening has identified vulnerabilities associated with both the cell of origin and transcription deregulation in paediatric cancer, which have become a valuable resource for designing new therapeutic approaches including those for small molecules, immunotherapy and targeted protein degradation. In this Review, we present recent findings on these facets of paediatric cancer from a pan-cancer perspective and provide an outlook on future investigations.",

			"abstract": "The cancer paradigm is generally based on the somatic mutation model, asserting that cancer is a disease of genetic origin. The mitochondrial-stem cell connection (MSCC) proposes that tumorigenesis may result from an alteration of the mitochondria, specifically a chronic oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) insufficiency in stem cells, which forms cancer stem cells (CSCs) and leads to malignancy. Reviewed evidence suggests that the MSCC could provide a comprehensive understanding of all the different stages of cancer. The metabolism of cancer cells is altered (OxPhos insufficiency) and must be compensated by using the glycolysis and the glutaminolysis pathways, which are essential to their growth. The altered mitochondria regulate the tumor microenvironment, which is also necessary for cancer evolution. Therefore, the MSCC could help improve our understanding of tumorigenesis, metastases, the efficiency of standard treatments, and relapses.",

			"abstract": "Cancer development is characterized by chromosomal instability, manifesting in frequent occurrences of different genomic alteration mechanisms ranging in extent and impact. Mathematical modeling can help evaluate the role of each mutational process during tumor progression, however existing frameworks can only capture certain aspects of chromosomal instability (CIN). We present CINner, a mathematical framework for modeling genomic diversity and selection during tumor evolution. The main advantage of CINner is its flexibility to incorporate many genomic events that directly impact cellular fitness, from driver gene mutations to copy number alterations (CNAs), including focal amplifications and deletions, missegregations and whole-genome duplication (WGD). We apply CINner to find chromosome-arm selection parameters that drive tumorigenesis in the absence of WGD in chromosomally stable cancer types. We found that the selection parameters predict WGD prevalence among different chromosomally unstable tumors, hinting that the selective advantage of WGD cells hinges on their tolerance for aneuploidy and escape from nullisomy. Direct application of CINner to model the WGD proportion and fraction of genome altered (FGA) further uncovers the increase in CNA probabilities associated with WGD in each cancer type. CINner can also be utilized to study chromosomally stable cancer types, by applying a selection model based on driver gene mutations and focal amplifications or deletions. Finally, we used CINner to analyze the impact of CNA probabilities, chromosome selection parameters, tumor growth dynamics and population size on cancer fitness and heterogeneity. We expect that CINner will provide a powerful modeling tool for the oncology community to quantify the impact of newly uncovered genomic alteration mechanisms on shaping tumor progression and adaptation.",

			"abstract": "The basal breast cancer subtype is enriched for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and displays consistent large chromosomal deletions. Here, we characterize evolution and maintenance of chromosome 4p (chr4p) loss in basal breast cancer. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data shows recurrent deletion of chr4p in basal breast cancer. Phylogenetic analysis of a panel of 23 primary tumor/patient-derived xenograft basal breast cancers reveals early evolution of chr4p deletion. Mechanistically we show that chr4p loss is associated with enhanced proliferation. Gene function studies identify an unknown gene, C4orf19, within chr4p, which suppresses proliferation when overexpressed-a member of the PDCD10-GCKIII kinase module we name PGCKA1. Genome-wide pooled overexpression screens using a barcoded library of human open reading frames identify chromosomal regions, including chr4p, that suppress proliferation when overexpressed in a context-dependent manner, implicating network interactions. Together, these results shed light on the early emergence of complex aneuploid karyotypes involving chr4p and adaptive landscapes shaping breast cancer genomes.",

			"abstract": "Cultural processes of change bear many resemblances to biological evolution. The underlying units of non-biological evolution have, however, remained elusive, especially in the domain of music. Here, we introduce a general framework to jointly identify underlying units and their associated evolutionary processes. We model musical styles and principles of organization in dimensions such as harmony and form as following an evolutionary process. Furthermore, we propose that such processes can be identified by extracting latent evolutionary signatures from musical corpora, analogously to identifying mutational signatures in genomics. These signatures provide a latent embedding for each song or musical piece. We develop a deep generative architecture for our model, which can be viewed as a type of variational autoencoder with an evolutionary prior constraining the latent space; specifically, the embeddings for each song are tied together via an energy-based prior, which encourages songs close in evolutionary space to share similar representations. As illustration, we analyse songs from the McGill Billboard dataset. We find frequent chord transitions and formal repetition schemes and identify latent evolutionary signatures related to these features. Finally, we show that the latent evolutionary representations learned by our model outperform non-evolutionary representations in such tasks as period and genre prediction.",

Inhibitors targeting various effectors within the ERKp have been developed and explored for over two decades. Conversely, a substantial body of evidence suggests that both normal human cells and, notably to a greater extent, cancer cells exhibit susceptibility to hyperactivation of ERKp. However, this vulnerability of cancer cells remains relatively unexplored. In this review, we reexamine the evidence on the selective lethality of highly elevated ERKp activity in human cancer cells of varying backgrounds. We synthesize the insights proposed for harnessing this vulnerability of ERK-associated cancers for therapeutical approaches and contextualize these insights within established pharmacological cancer-targeting models. Moreover, we compile the intriguing preclinical findings of ERK pathway agonism in diverse cancer models. Lastly, we present a conceptual framework for target discovery regarding ERKp agonism, emphasizing the utilization of mutual exclusivity among oncogenes to develop novel targeted therapies for precision oncology.",

			"abstract": "The timing and fitness effect of somatic copy number alterations (SCNA) in cancer evolution remains poorly understood. Here we present a framework to determine the timing of a clonal SCNA that encompasses multiple gains. This involves calculating the proportion of time from its last gain to the onset of population expansion (lead time) as well as the proportion of time prior to its first gain (initiation time). Our method capitalizes on the observation that a genomic segment, while in a specific copy number (CN) state, accumulates point mutations proportionally to its CN. Analyzing 184 whole genome sequenced samples from 75 patients across five tumor types, we commonly observe late gains following early initiating events, occurring just before the clonal expansion relevant to the sampling. These include gains acquired after genome doubling in more than 60% of cases. Notably, mathematical modeling suggests that late clonal gains may contain final-expansion drivers. Lastly, SCNAs bolster mutational diversification between subpopulations, exacerbating the circle of proliferation and increasing heterogeneity.",

We investigated the genomic evolution of prostate cancer through the application of three separate classification methods, each designed to investigate a different aspect of tumor evolution. Integrating the results revealed the existence of two distinct types of prostate cancer that arise from divergent evolutionary trajectories, designated as the Canonical and Alternative evolutionary disease types. We therefore propose the evotype model for prostate cancer evolution wherein Alternative-evotype tumors diverge from those of the Canonical-evotype through the stochastic accumulation of genetic alterations associated with disruptions to androgen receptor DNA binding. Our model unifies many previous molecular observations, providing a powerful new framework to investigate prostate cancer disease progression.",

			"abstract": "Cell division is a crucial process, and one of its essential steps involves copying the genetic material, which is organized into structures called chromosomes. Before a cell can divide into two, it needs to ensure that each newly copied chromosome is paired tightly with its identical twin. This pairing is maintained by a protein complex known as cohesin, which is conserved in various organisms, from single-celled ones to humans. Cohesin essentially encircles the DNA, creating a ring-like structure to handcuff, to keep the newly synthesized sister chromosomes together in pairs. Therefore, chromosomal cohesion and separation are fundamental processes governing the attachment and segregation of sister chromatids during cell division. Metaphase-to-anaphase transition requires dissolution of cohesins by the enzyme Separase. The tight regulation of these processes is vital for safeguarding genomic stability. Dysregulation in chromosomal cohesion and separation resulting in aneuploidy, a condition characterized by an abnormal chromosome count in a cell, is strongly associated with cancer. Aneuploidy is a recurring hallmark in many cancer types, and abnormalities in chromosomal cohesion and separation have been identified as significant contributors to various cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, colorectal, bladder, and other solid cancers. Mutations within the cohesin complex have been associated with these cancers, as they interfere with chromosomal segregation, genome organization, and gene expression, promoting aneuploidy and contributing to the initiation of malignancy. In summary, chromosomal cohesion and separation processes play a pivotal role in preserving genomic stability, and aberrations in these mechanisms can lead to aneuploidy and cancer. Gaining a deeper understanding of the molecular intricacies of chromosomal cohesion and separation offers promising prospects for the development of innovative therapeutic approaches in the battle against cancer.",

Here, we extensively characterize multiple sequential and parallel multiregion tumor and blood specimens of an index patient and a cohort of metastatic triple-negative breast cancers. We demonstrate that a continuous increase in tumor genomic heterogeneity and distinct molecular clocks correlated with resistance to treatment, eventually allowing tumors to escape from immune control. TCR repertoire loses diversity over time, leading to convergent evolution as breast cancer progresses. Although mixed populations of effector memory and cytotoxic single T cells coexist in the peripheral blood, defects in the antigen presentation machinery coupled with subdued T cell recruitment into metastases are observed, indicating a potent immune avoidance microenvironment not compatible with an effective antitumor response in lethal metastatic disease. Our results demonstrate that the immune responses against cancer are not static, but rather follow dynamic processes that match cancer genomic progression, illustrating the complex nature of tumor and immune cell interactions.",

			"abstract": "Paediatric and adult astrocytomas are notably different, where clinical treatments used for adults are not as effective on children with the same form of cancer and these treatments lead to adverse long-term health concerns. Integrative omics-based studies have shown the pathology and fundamental molecular characteristics differ significantly and cannot be extrapolated from the more widely studied adult disease. Recent clinical advances in our understanding of paediatric astrocytomas, with the aid of next-generation sequencing and epigenome-wide profiling, have led to the identification of key canonical mutations that vary based on the tumour location and age of onset. These driver mutations, in particular the identification of the recurrent histone H3 mutations in high-grade tumours, have confirmed the important role epigenetic dysregulations play in cancer progression. This review summarises the current updates of the classification, epidemiology, pathogenesis and clinical management of paediatric astrocytoma based on their grades and the ongoing clinical trials. It also provides novel insights on genetic and epigenetic alterations as diagnostic biomarkers, highlighting the potential of targeting these pathways as therapeutics for this devastating childhood cancer.",

This added capability through protein design allows these man-made molecules to address unmet medical needs that are no longer possible with single targeting such as with monoclonal antibodies or cytokines alone. However, the approach to the development of these multispecific molecules has been met with numerous road bumps, which suggests that a new workflow for multispecific molecules is required. The investigation of the molecular basis that mediates the successful assembly of the building blocks into non-native quaternary structures will lead to the writing of a playbook for multispecifics. This is a must do if we are to design workflows that we can control and in turn predict success. Here, we reflect on the current state-of-the-art of therapeutic biologics and look at the building blocks, in terms of proteins, and tools that can be used to build the foundations of such a next-generation workflow.",

We applied this technology to analyze 447 transcriptomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and benign liver from an individual. Through Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection analysis, we identified a panel of mutation mRNA isoforms highly specific to HCC cells. The evolution pathways that led to the hyper-mutation clusters in single human leukocyte antigen molecules were identified. Novel fusion transcripts were detected. The combination of gene expressions, fusion gene transcripts, and mutation gene expressions significantly improved the classification of liver cancer cells versus benign hepatocytes. In conclusion, LOOPSeq single-cell technology may hold promise to provide a new level of precision analysis on the mammalian transcriptome.",

The dissemination process is poorly understood from a cancer evolutionary perspective. We reconstructed the evolutionary trajectories across a median of 5 tumor sites and regions from each of 23 patients based on deep whole-exome sequencing. Polyclonal cancer origin was detected in 1 patient. Ovarian tumors had more complex subclonal architectures than other intraperitoneal tumors in each patient, which indicated that tumors developed earlier in the ovaries. Three common modes of dissemination were identified, including monoclonal or polyclonal dissemination of monophyletic (linear) or polyphyletic (branched) subclones. Mutation profiles of initial or disseminated clones varied greatly among cancers, but recurrent mutations were found in 7 cancer-critical genes, including TP53, BRCA1, BRCA2, and DNMT3A, and in the PI3K/AKT1 pathway. Disseminated clones developed late in the evolutionary trajectory models of most cancers, in particular in cancers with DNA damage repair deficiency. Polyclonal dissemination was predicted to occur predominantly as a single and rapid wave, but chemotherapy exposure was associated with higher genomic diversity of disseminated clones. In conclusion, we described three common evolutionary dissemination modes across HGSCs and proposed factors associated with dissemination diversity.",

			"abstract": "Inactivating TP53 mutations leads to a loss of function of p53, but can also often result in oncogenic gain-of-function (GOF) of mutant p53 (mutp53) proteins which promotes tumor development and progression. The GOF activities of TP53 mutations are well documented, but the mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. Here, we study the mutp53 interactome and find that by targeting minichromosome maintenance complex components (MCMs), GOF mutp53 predisposes cells to replication stress and chromosomal instability (CIN), leading to a tumor cell-autonomous and cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-dependent cytosolic DNA response that activates downstream non-canonical nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cell (NC-NF-\u03baB) signaling. Consequently, GOF mutp53-MCMs-CIN-cytosolic DNA-cGAS-STING-NC-NF-\u03baB signaling promotes tumor cell metastasis and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment through antagonizing interferon signaling and regulating genes associated with pro-tumorigenic inflammation. Our findings have important implications for understanding not only the GOF activities of TP53 mutations but also the genome-guardian role of p53 and its inactivation during tumor development and progression.",

Normal cells acquire mutations in oncogenic driver genes and have a selective advantage over other cells, becoming tumor initiating cells; In the interaction with the tumor microenvironment (TME), the vast majority of initiating cells are recognized and killed by the human immune system. If immune escape occurs, the incidence of malignant tumors will greatly increase, and subclonal expansion, intratumour heterogeneity, etc. will occur.

While many studies have described the landscapes of clonal genome evolution in cancer, few determine the underlying evolutionary parameters from molecular data, and even fewer integrate theory with data. We derived theoretical results linking mutation rate, time, expansion dynamics, and biological/clinical parameters. Subsequently, we inferred time-resolved estimates of evolutionary parameters from mutation accumulation, mutational signatures and selection. We then applied this framework to predict the time of speciation of the marbled crayfish, an enigmatic, globally invasive parthenogenetic freshwater crayfish. The results predict that speciation occurred between 1986 and 1990, which is consistent with biological records. We also used our framework to analyze whole-genome sequencing datasets from primary and relapsed glioblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor. The results identified evolutionary subgroups and showed that tumor cell survival could be inferred from genomic data that was generated during the resection of the primary tumor. In conclusion, our framework allowed a time-resolved, integrated analysis of key parameters in clonally evolving genomes, and provided novel insights into the evolutionary age of marbled crayfish and the progression of glioblastoma.",

			"abstract": "Intratumor heterogeneity provides the fuel for the evolution and selection of subclonal tumor cell populations. However, accurate inference of tumor subclonal architecture and reconstruction of tumor evolutionary histories from bulk DNA sequencing data remains challenging. Frequently, sequencing and alignment artifacts are not fully filtered out from cancer somatic mutations, and errors in the identification of copy number alterations or complex evolutionary events (e.g., mutation losses) affect the estimated cellular prevalence of mutations. Together, such errors propagate into the analysis of mutation clustering and phylogenetic reconstruction. In this Protocol, we present a new computational framework, CONIPHER (COrrecting Noise In PHylogenetic Evaluation and Reconstruction), that accurately infers subclonal structure and phylogenetic relationships from multisample tumor sequencing, accounting for both copy number alterations and mutation errors. CONIPHER has been used to reconstruct subclonal architecture and tumor phylogeny from multisample tumors with high-depth whole-exome sequencing from the TRACERx421 dataset, as well as matched primary-metastatic cases. CONIPHER outperforms similar methods on simulated datasets, and in particular scales to a large number of tumor samples and clones, while completing in under 1.5 h on average. CONIPHER enables automated phylogenetic analysis that can be effectively applied to large sequencing datasets generated with different technologies. CONIPHER can be run with a basic knowledge of bioinformatics and R and bash scripting languages.",

			"abstract": "Cancer occurs as a consequence of multiple somatic mutations that lead to uncontrolled cell growth. Mutual exclusivity and co-occurrence of mutations imply-but do not prove-that mutations exert synergistic or antagonistic epistatic effects on oncogenesis. Knowledge of these interactions, and the consequent trajectories of mutation and selection that lead to cancer has been a longstanding goal within the cancer research community. Recent research has revealed mutation rates and scaled selection coefficients for specific recurrent variants across many cancer types. However, there are no current methods to quantify the strength of selection incorporating pairwise and higher-order epistatic effects on selection within the trajectory of likely cancer genotoypes. Therefore, we have developed a continuous-time Markov chain model that enables the estimation of mutation origination and fixation (flux), dependent on somatic cancer genotype. Coupling this continuous-time Markov chain model with a deconvolution approach provides estimates of underlying mutation rates and selection across the trajectory of oncogenesis. We demonstrate computation of fluxes and selection coefficients in a somatic evolutionary model for the four most frequently variant driver genes (TP53, LRP1B, KRAS and STK11) from 565 cases of lung adenocarcinoma. Our analysis reveals multiple antagonistic epistatic effects that reduce the possible routes of oncogenesis, and inform cancer research regarding viable trajectories of somatic evolution whose progression could be forestalled by precision medicine. Synergistic epistatic effects are also identified, most notably in the somatic genotype TP53 LRP1B for mutations in the KRAS gene, and in somatic genotypes containing KRAS or TP53 mutations for mutations in the STK11 gene. Large positive fluxes of KRAS variants were driven by large selection coefficients, whereas the flux toward LRP1B mutations was substantially aided by a large mutation rate for this gene. The approach enables inference of the most likely routes of site-specific variant evolution and estimation of the strength of selection operating on each step along the route, a key component of what we need to know to develop and implement personalized cancer therapies.",

			"abstract": "The gene dosage compensation hypothesis presents a mechanism through which the expression of certain genes is modulated to compensate for differences in the dose of genes when additional chromosomes are present. It is one of the means through which cancer cells actively cope with the potential damaging effects of aneuploidy, a hallmark of most cancers. Dosage compensation arises through several processes, including downregulation or overexpression of specific genes and the relocation of dosage-sensitive genes. In cancer, a majority of compensated genes are generally thought to be regulated at the translational or post-translational level, and include the basic components of a compensation loop, including sensors of gene dosage and modulators of gene expression. Post-translational regulation is mostly undertaken by a general degradation or aggregation of remaining protein subunits of macromolecular complexes. An increasingly important role has also been observed for transcriptional level regulation. This article reviews the process of targeted gene dosage compensation in cancer and other biological conditions, along with the mechanisms by which cells regulate specific genes to restore cellular homeostasis. These mechanisms represent potential targets for the inhibition of dosage compensation of specific genes in aneuploid cancers. This article critically examines the process of targeted gene dosage compensation in cancer and other biological contexts, alongside the criteria for identifying genes subject to dosage compensation and the intricate mechanisms by which cells orchestrate the regulation of specific genes to reinstate cellular homeostasis. Ultimately, our aim is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the intricate nature of a systems-level property. This property hinges upon the kinetic parameters of regulatory motifs, which we have termed \"gene dosage sensor loops.\" These loops have the potential to operate at both the transcriptional and translational levels, thus emerging as promising candidates for the inhibition of dosage compensation in specific genes. Additionally, they represent novel and highly specific therapeutic targets in the context of aneuploid cancer.",

			"abstract": "Medical oncology is rapidly evolving with the implementation of personalized, targeted therapies. Advances in molecular diagnostics and the biologic understanding of cancer pathophysiology led to the identification of specific genetic alterations as drivers of cancer progression. Further, improvements in drug development enable the direct interference with these pathways, which allow tailoring personalized treatments based on a distinct molecular characterization of tumors. Thereby, we are currently experiencing a paradigm-shift in the treatment of cancers towards cancer-type agnostic, molecularly targeted, personalized therapies. However, this concept has several important hurdles and limitations to overcome to ultimately increase the proportion of patients benefitting from the precision oncology approach. These include the assessment of clinical relevancy of identified alterations, capturing and interpreting levels of heterogeneity based on intra-tumoral or time-dependent molecular evolution, and challenges in the practical implementation of precision oncology in routine clinical care. In the present review, we summarize the current state of cancer-agnostic precision oncology, discuss the concept of molecular tumor boards, and consider current limitations of personalized cancer therapy. Further, we provide an outlook towards potential future developments including the implementation of functionality assessments of identified genetic alterations and the broader use of liquid biopsies in order to obtain more comprehensive and longitudinal genetic information that might guide personalized cancer therapy in the future.",

			"abstract": "11q13 amplification is a frequent event in human cancer and in particular in squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). Despite almost invariably spanning 10 genes, it is unclear which genetic components of the amplicon are the key driver events in SCC. A combination of computational, in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models leveraging efficient primary human keratinocyte genome editing by Cas9-RNP electroporation, identified ORAOV1, CCND1, and MIR548K as the critical drivers of the amplicon in head and neck SCC. CCND1 amplification drives the cell cycle in a CDK4/6/RB1-independent fashion and may confer a novel dependency on RRM2. MIR548K contributes to epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Finally, we identify ORAOV1 as an oncogene that acts likely via its ability to modulate reactive oxygen species. Thus, the 11q13 amplicon drives SCC through at least three independent genetic elements and suggests therapeutic targets for this morbid and lethal disease.",

The genetic makeup of CAC is somewhat similar to sporadic colorectal carcinoma (sCRC), but there are differences in the sequence and timing of alterations in the carcinogenesis process. Several models have been developed to explain the development of CAC, particularly the \"field cancerization\" model, which proposes that chronic inflammation accelerates mutagenesis and selects for the clonal expansion of phenotypically normal, pro-tumorigenic cells. In contrast, the \"Big Bang\" model posits that tumorigenic clones with multiple driver gene mutations emerge spontaneously. The details of CAC tumorigenesis-and how they differ from sCRC-are not yet fully understood. In this Review, we discuss recent genetic, epigenetic, and environmental findings related to CAC pathogenesis in the past five years, with a focus on unbiased, high-resolution genetic profiling of non-dysplastic field cancerization in the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).",

However, it is poorly tolerated in healthy cells: during development and tissue homeostasis, aneuploid cells are efficiently cleared from the population. It is still largely unknown how cancer cells become, and adapt to being, aneuploid. P53, the gatekeeper of the genome, has been proposed to guard against aneuploidy. Aneuploidy in cancer genomes strongly correlates with mutations in TP53, and p53 is thought to prevent the propagation of aneuploid cells. Whether p53 also participates in preventing the mistakes in cell division that lead to aneuploidy is still under debate. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the role of p53 in protecting cells from aneuploidy, and we explore the consequences of functional p53 loss for the propagation of aneuploidy in cancer.",

			"abstract": "Multiple large-scale genomic profiling efforts have been undertaken in osteosarcoma to define the genomic drivers of tumorigenesis, therapeutic response, and disease recurrence. The spatial and temporal intratumor heterogeneity could also play a role in promoting tumor growth and treatment resistance. We conducted longitudinal whole-genome sequencing of 37 tumor samples from 8 patients with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma. Each patient had at least one sample from a primary site and a metastatic or relapse site. Subclonal copy-number alterations were identified in all patients except one. In 5 patients, subclones from the primary tumor emerged and dominated at subsequent relapses. MYC gain/amplification was enriched in the treatment-resistant clones in 6 of 7 patients with multiple clones. Amplifications in other potential driver genes, such as CCNE1, RAD21, VEGFA, and IGF1R, were also observed in the resistant copy-number clones. A chromosomal duplication timing analysis revealed that complex genomic rearrangements typically occurred prior to diagnosis, supporting a macroevolutionary model of evolution, where a large number of genomic aberrations are acquired over a short period of time followed by clonal selection, as opposed to ongoing evolution. A mutational signature analysis of recurrent tumors revealed that homologous repair deficiency (HRD)-related SBS3 increases at each time point in patients with recurrent disease, suggesting that HRD continues to be an active mutagenic process after diagnosis. Overall, by examining the clonal relationships between temporally and spatially separated samples from patients with relapsed/refractory osteosarcoma, this study sheds light on the intratumor heterogeneity and potential drivers of treatment resistance in this disease.",

			"abstract": "Intracranial metastases in prostate cancer are uncommon but clinically aggressive. A detailed molecular characterization of prostate cancer intracranial metastases would improve our understanding of their pathogenesis and the search for new treatment strategies. We evaluated the clinical and molecular characteristics of 36 patients with metastatic prostate cancer to either the dura or brain parenchyma. We performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 10 intracranial prostate cancer metastases, as well as WGS of primary prostate tumors from men who later developed metastatic disease (n\u2009=\u20096) and nonbrain prostate cancer metastases (n\u2009=\u200936). This first whole genome sequencing study of prostate intracranial metastases led to several new insights. First, there was a higher diversity of complex structural alterations in prostate cancer intracranial metastases compared to primary tumor tissues. Chromothripsis and chromoplexy events seemed to dominate, yet there were few enrichments of specific categories of structural variants compared with non-brain metastases. Second, aberrations involving the AR gene, including AR enhancer gain were observed in 7/10 (70%) of intracranial metastases, as well as recurrent loss of function aberrations involving TP53 in 8/10 (80%), RB1 in 2/10 (20%), BRCA2 in 2/10 (20%), and activation of the PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway in 8/10 (80%). These alterations were frequently present in tumor tissues from other sites of disease obtained concurrently or sequentially from the same individuals. Third, clonality analysis points to genomic factors and evolutionary bottlenecks that contribute to metastatic spread in patients with prostate cancer. These results describe the aggressive molecular features underlying intracranial metastasis that may inform future diagnostic and treatment approaches.",

In cancer evolution, continuous observation of clonal architecture is impossible, and longitudinal samples from multiple timepoints are rare. Increasingly available DNA sequencing datasets at single-cell resolution enable the reconstruction of past evolution using mutational history, allowing for a better understanding of dynamics prior to detectable disease. There is an unmet need for an accurate, fast, and easy-to-use method to quantify clone growth dynamics from these datasets.",

This chapter includes details of the three recently developed innovative tools, namely the Isan cohort database software, an OV-RDT for screening of O. viverrini, and an ultrasound telecommunication system. Past and current control programs, i.e., education, medication, and sanitation were discussed and stressed the need for a comprehensive control program which encompasses primary, secondary, and tertiary patient care programs for confirmation and management of suspected CCA cases. The approach of mathematical modeling for control of OV and CCA was also briefly described. Additionally, we highlighted the current progress toward control of OV and CCA in Thailand and potential for expansion into nearby countries in Southeast Asia.",

Here, we perform whole genome sequencing of 323 haematopoietic colonies from 10 individuals with the inherited ribosomopathy Shwachman-Diamond syndrome to reconstruct haematopoietic phylogenies. In ~30% of colonies, we identify mutually exclusive mutations in TP53, EIF6, RPL5, RPL22, PRPF8, plus chromosome 7 and 15 aberrations that increase SBDS and EFL1 gene dosage, respectively. Target gene mutations commence in utero, resulting in a profusion of clonal expansions, with only a few haematopoietic stem cell lineages (mean 8, range 1-24) contributing ~50% of haematopoietic colonies across 8 individuals (range 4-100% clonality) by young adulthood. Rapid clonal expansion during disease transformation is associated with biallelic TP53 mutations and increased mutation burden. Our study highlights how convergent somatic mutation of the p53-dependent nucleolar surveillance pathway offsets the deleterious effects of germline ribosomopathy but increases opportunity for TP53-mutated cancer evolution.",

			"abstract": "Reducing the morbidities caused by neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) is a central aim of ongoing disease control programmes. The broad spectrum of pathogens under the umbrella of NTDs lead to a range of negative health outcomes, from malnutrition and anaemia to organ failure, blindness and carcinogenesis. For some NTDs, the most severe clinical manifestations develop over many years of chronic or repeated infection. For these diseases, the association between infection and risk of long-term pathology is generally complex, and the impact of multiple interacting factors, such as age, co-morbidities and host immune response, is often poorly quantified. Mathematical modelling has been used for many years to gain insights into the complex processes underlying the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases; however, long-term morbidities associated with chronic or cumulative exposure are generally not incorporated into dynamic models for NTDs. Here we consider the complexities and challenges for determining the relationship between cumulative pathogen exposure and morbidity at the individual and population levels, drawing on case studies for trachoma, schistosomiasis and foodborne trematodiasis. We explore potential frameworks for explicitly incorporating long-term morbidity into NTD transmission models, and consider the insights such frameworks may bring in terms of policy-relevant projections for the elimination era. This article is part of the theme issue 'Challenges and opportunities in the fight against neglected tropical diseases: a decade from the London Declaration on NTDs'.",

We applied single cell sequencing datasets to define mRNA patterns and visualized potential cellular capacities among hepatocellular cancer cells. The expressing numbers and levels of genes were highly heterogenous among the cancer cells. The cellular characteristics were dependent strongly on the expressing numbers and levels of genes, especially oncogenes and anti-oncogenes, in an individual cancer cell. The transcriptional activations of oncogenes and anti-oncogenes were strongly linked to inherent multiple cellular programs, some of which oppose and contend against other processes, in a cancer cell. The gene expression networks of multiple cellular programs proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, autophagy, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, ATP production, and neurogenesis coexisted in an individual cancer cell. The findings give rise a hypothesis that a cancer cell expresses balanced combinations of genes and undergoes a given biological process by rapidly transmuting gene expressing networks.",

Characterizing and identifying the personalized driver mechanism for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) individuals were pivotal for the realization of precision medicine. We proposed an integrative method to identify the personalized driver gene sets by integrating the profiles of gene expression and genetic alterations in cancer individuals. This method coupled genetic algorithm and random walk to identify the optimal gene sets that could explain abnormality of transcriptome phenotype to the maximum extent. The personalized driver gene sets were identified for 99 GBM individuals using our method. We found that genomic alterations in between one and seven driver genes could maximally and cumulatively explain the dysfunction of cancer hallmarks across GBM individuals. The driver gene sets were distinct even in GBM individuals with significantly similar transcriptomic phenotypes. Our method identified MCM4 with rare genetic alterations as previously unknown oncogenic genes, the high expression of which were significantly associated with poor GBM prognosis. The functional experiments confirmed that knockdown of MCM4 could significantly inhibit proliferation, invasion, migration, and clone formation of the GBM cell lines U251 and U118MG, and overexpression of MCM4 significantly promoted the proliferation, invasion, migration, and clone formation of the GBM cell line U87MG. Our method could dissect the personalized driver genetic alteration sets that are pivotal for developing targeted therapy strategies and precision medicine. Our method could be extended to identify key drivers from other levels and could be applied to more cancer types.",

The mutational landscape is dominated by the C[T\u2009>\u2009C/G]T substitution enriched signatures SBS17a/b, which are linked with TP53 mutations, increased proliferation, genomic instability and disease progression. The APOBEC mutagenesis signature is a weak but persistent signal amplified in primary tumours. We also identify prevalent alterations in DNA damage repair pathways, with homologous recombination, base and nucleotide excision repair and translesion synthesis mutated in up to 50% of the cohort, and surprisingly uncoupled from transcriptional activity. Among these, the presence of base excision repair deficiencies show remarkably poor prognosis in the cohort. In this work, we provide insights on the mutational aetiology and changes enabling the transition from pre-neoplastic to advanced oesophageal adenocarcinoma.",

However, the connection between hypoxia and hormonal cell signaling pathways is unclear, but such human age-related comorbid diseases do coincide with the middle-aging period of declining sex hormonal signaling. This scoping review evaluates the relevant interdisciplinary evidence to assess the systems biology of function, regulation, and homeostasis in order to discern and decipher the etiology of the connection between hypoxia and hormonal signaling in human age-related comorbid diseases. The hypothesis charts the accumulating evidence to support the development of a hypoxic milieu and oxidative stress-inflammation pathophysiology in middle-aged individuals, as well as the induction of amyloidosis, autophagy, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in aging-related degeneration. Taken together, this new approach and strategy can provide the clarity of concepts and patterns to determine the causes of declining vascularity hemodynamics (blood flow) and physiological oxygenation perfusion (oxygen bioavailability) in relation to oxygen homeostasis and vascularity that cause hypoxia (hypovascularity hypoxia). The middle-aging hypovascularity hypoxia hypothesis could provide the mechanistic interface connecting the endocrine, nitric oxide, and oxygen homeostasis signaling that is closely linked to the progressive conditions of degenerative hypertrophy, atrophy, fibrosis, and neoplasm. An in-depth understanding of these intrinsic biological processes of the developing middle-aged hypoxia could provide potential new strategies for time-dependent therapies in maintaining healthspan for healthy lifestyle aging, medical cost savings, and health system sustainability.",

To this end, we present a novel probabilistic framework, called TreeMHN, for the joint inference of exclusivity patterns and recurrent trajectories from a cohort of intra-tumor phylogenetic trees. Through simulations, we show that TreeMHN outperforms existing alternatives that can only focus on one aspect of the task. By analyzing datasets of blood, lung, and breast cancers, we find the most likely evolutionary trajectories and mutational patterns, consistent with and enriching our current understanding of tumorigenesis. Moreover, TreeMHN facilitates the prediction of tumor evolution and provides probabilistic measures on the next mutational events given a tumor tree, a prerequisite for evolution-guided treatment strategies.",

			"abstract": "Chromosome instability is a well-known hallmark of cancer, leading to increased genetic plasticity of tumoral cells, which favors cancer aggressiveness, and poor prognosis. One of the main sources of chromosomal instability are events that lead to a Whole-Genome Duplication (WGD) and the subsequently generated cell polyploidy. In recent years, several studies showed that WGD occurs at the early stages of cell transformation, which allows cells to later become aneuploid, thus leading to cancer progression. On the other hand, other studies convey that polyploidy plays a tumor suppressor role, by inducing cell cycle arrest, cell senescence, apoptosis, and even prompting cell differentiation, depending on the tissue cell type. There is still a gap in understanding how cells that underwent WGD can overcome the deleterious effect on cell fitness and evolve to become tumoral. Some laboratories in the chromosomal instability field recently explored this paradox, finding biomarkers that modulate polyploid cells to become oncogenic. This review brings a historical view of how WGD and polyploidy impact cell fitness and cancer progression, and bring together the last studies that describe the genes helping cells to adapt to polyploidy.",

			"abstract": "Many factors, including reproductive hormones, have been linked to a woman's risk of developing breast cancer (BC). We reviewed the literature regarding the relationship between ovulatory menstrual cycles (MCs) and BC risk. Physiological variations in the frequency of MCs and interference with MCs through genetic variations, pathological conditions and or pharmaceutical interventions revealed a strong link between BC risk and the lifetime number of MCs. A substantial reduction in BC risk is observed in situations without MCs. In genetic or transgender situations with normal female breasts and estrogens, but no progesterone (P4), the incidence of BC is very low, suggesting an essential role of P4. During the MC, P4 has a strong proliferative effect on normal breast epithelium, whereas estradiol (E2) has only a minimal effect. The origin of BC has been strongly linked to proliferation associated DNA replication errors, and the repeated stimulation of the breast epithelium by P4 with each MC is likely to impact the epithelial mutational burden. Long-lived cells, such as stem cells, present in the breast epithelium, can carry mutations forward for an extended period of time, and studies show that breast tumors tend to take decades to develop before detection. We therefore postulate that P4 is an important factor in a woman's lifetime risk of developing BC, and that breast tumors arising during hormonal contraception or after menopause, with or without menopausal hormone therapy, are the consequence of the outgrowth of pre-existing neoplastic lesions, eventually stimulated by estrogens and some progestins.",

The interaction of PD-1 and PD-L1 can inhibit T-cell responses by decreasing T-cell activity and accelerating their apoptosis. Various cancers express high levels of PD-L1 and exploit PD-L1/PD-1 signaling to evade T-cell immunity, and immunotherapies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have been shown to exert remarkable anti-tumor effects; however, not all tumor patients benefit from these therapies. Therefore, study of the mechanisms regulating PD-L1 expression are imperative. In this review, we explore regulation of PD-L1 expression in the contexts of gene transcription, signaling pathways, histone modification and remodeling, microRNAs, long noncoding RNAs, and post-translational modification. Current developments in studies of agents that block PD-L1 and correlations between immunotherapies targeting PD-1/PD-L1 and PD-L1 expression are also summarized. Our review will assist in understanding of PD-L1 expression regulation and discusses the implications of reported findings in cancer diagnosis and immunotherapy.",

The genomic basis of iAMP21-ALL and the pathogenic role of the region of amplification of chromosome 21 to leukemogenesis remains incompletely understood. In this study, using integrated whole genome and transcriptome sequencing of 124 patients with iAMP21-ALL, including rare cases arising in the context of constitutional chromosomal aberrations, we identified subgroups of iAMP21-ALL based on the patterns of copy number alteration and structural variation. This large data set enabled formal delineation of a 7.8 Mb common region of amplification harboring 71 genes, 43 of which were differentially expressed compared with non-iAMP21-ALL ones, including multiple genes implicated in the pathogenesis of acute leukemia (CHAF1B, DYRK1A, ERG, HMGN1, and RUNX1). Using multimodal single-cell genomic profiling, including single-cell whole genome sequencing of 2 cases, we documented clonal heterogeneity and genomic evolution, demonstrating that the acquisition of the iAMP21 chromosome is an early event that may undergo progressive amplification during disease ontogeny. We show that UV-mutational signatures and high mutation load are characteristic secondary genetic features. Although the genomic alterations of chromosome 21 are variable, these integrated genomic analyses and demonstration of an extended common minimal region of amplification broaden the definition of iAMP21-ALL for more precise diagnosis using cytogenetic or genomic methods to inform clinical management.",

As most studies to date focused on diagnosis-relapse pairs, our understanding of the genetic and clonal dynamics of metastatic spread and disease progression remain limited. Here, using genomic profiling of 470 sequential and spatially separated samples from 283 patients, we characterize subtype-specific genetic evolutionary trajectories from diagnosis through progression and end-stage metastatic disease. Clonal tracing timed disease initiation to embryogenesis. Continuous acquisition of structural variants at disease-defining loci (MYCN, TERT, MDM2-CDK4) followed by convergent evolution of mutations targeting shared pathways emerged as the predominant feature of progression. At diagnosis metastatic clones were already established at distant sites where they could stay dormant, only to cause relapses years later and spread via metastasis-to-metastasis and polyclonal seeding after therapy.",

			"abstract": "Despite advances in treatments over the last decades, a uniformly reliable and free of side effects therapy of human cancers remains to be achieved. During chromosome replication, a premature halt of two converging DNA replication forks would cause incomplete replication and a cytotoxic chromosome nondisjunction during mitosis. In contrast to normal cells, most cancer cells bear numerous DNA deletions. A homozygous deletion permanently marks a cell and its descendants. Here, we propose an approach to cancer therapy in which a pair of sequence-specific roadblocks is placed solely at two cancer-confined deletion sites that are located ahead of two converging replication forks. We describe this method, termed \"replication blocks specific for deletions\" (RBSD), and another deletions-based approach as well. RBSD can be expanded by placing pairs of replication roadblocks on several different chromosomes. The resulting simultaneous nondisjunctions of these chromosomes in cancer cells would further increase the cancer-specific toxicity of RBSD.",

In this study, we performed a comprehensive in silico analysis to elucidate the effects of silent mutations on cancer pathogenesis using exome sequencing data derived from the Cancer Genome Atlas. We focused on the codon optimality scores of silent mutations, which were defined as the difference between the optimality of synonymous codons, calculated using the codon usage table. The relationship between cancer evolution and silent mutations showed that the codon optimality score of the mutations that occurred later in carcinogenesis was significantly higher than of those that occurred earlier. In addition, mutations with higher scores were enriched in genes involved in the cell cycle and cell division, while those with lower scores were enriched in genes involved in apoptosis and cellular senescence. Our results demonstrate that some silent mutations can be involved in cancer pathogenesis.",

			"abstract": "Cancer remains a formidable challenge in medicine due to its propensity for recurrence and metastasis, which can result in unfavorable treatment outcomes. This challenge is particularly acute for early-stage patients, who may experience recurrence and metastasis without timely detection. Here, we first analyzed the differences in clinical characteristics among the primary tumor, recurrent tumor, and metastatic tumor in different stages of cancer, which may be caused by the molecular level. Moreover, the importance of predicting early cancer recurrence and metastasis is emphasized by survival analyses. Next, we used a multi-omics approach to identify key molecular changes associated with early cancer recurrence and metastasis and discovered that early metastasis in cancer demonstrated a high degree of genomic and cellular heterogeneity. We performed statistical comparisons for each level of omics data including gene expression, mutation, copy number variation, immune cell infiltration, and cell status. Then, various analytical techniques, such as proportional hazard model and Fisher's exact test, were used to identify specific genes or immune characteristics associated with early cancer recurrence and metastasis. For example, we observed that the overexpression of BPIFB1 and high initial B-cell infiltration levels are linked to early cancer recurrence, while the overexpression or amplification of ANKRD22 and LIPM, mutation of IGHA1 and MUC16, high fibroblast infiltration level, M1 polarization of macrophages, cellular status of DNA repair are all linked to early cancer metastasis. These findings have led us to construct classifiers, and the average area under the curve (AUC) of these classifiers was greater than 0.75 in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cancer patients, confirming that the features we identified could be biomarkers for predicting recurrence and metastasis of early cancer. Finally, we identified specific early sensitive targets for targeted therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Once the biomarkers we identified changed, treatment-sensitive targets can be treated accordingly. Our study has comprehensively characterized the multi-omics characteristics and identified a panel of biomarkers of early cancer recurrence and metastasis. Overall, it provides a valuable resource for cancer recurrence and metastasis research and improves our understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving early cancer recurrence and metastasis.",

To address the complexity of the cancer-genomic landscape and extract meaningful insights, numerous computational approaches have been developed over the last two decades. In this review, we survey the current leading computational methods to derive intricate mutational patterns in the context of clinical relevance. We begin with mutation signatures, explaining first how mutation signatures were developed and then examining the utility of studies using mutation signatures to correlate environmental effects on the cancer genome. Next, we examine current clinical research that employs mutation signatures and discuss the potential use cases and challenges of mutation signatures in clinical decision-making. We then examine computational studies developing tools to investigate complex patterns of mutations beyond the context of mutational signatures. We survey methods to identify cancer-driver genes, from single-driver studies to pathway and network analyses. In addition, we review methods inferring complex combinations of mutations for clinical tasks and using mutations integrated with multi-omics data to better predict cancer phenotypes. We examine the use of these tools for either discovery or prediction, including prediction of tumor origin, treatment outcomes, prognosis, and cancer typing. We further discuss the main limitations preventing widespread clinical integration of computational tools for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. We end by proposing solutions to address these challenges using recent advances in machine learning.",

			"abstract": "Various cancer types exhibit characteristic and recurrent aneuploidy patterns. The origins of these cancer type-specific karyotypes are still unknown, partly because introducing or eliminating specific chromosomes in human cells still poses a challenge. Here, we describe a novel strategy to induce mis-segregation of specific chromosomes in different human cell types. We employed Tet repressor or nuclease-dead Cas9 to link a microtubule minus-end-directed kinesin (Kinesin14VIb) from Physcomitrella patens to integrated Tet operon repeats and chromosome-specific endogenous repeats, respectively. By live- and fixed-cell imaging, we observed poleward movement of the targeted loci during (pro)metaphase. Kinesin14VIb-mediated pulling forces on the targeted chromosome were counteracted by forces from kinetochore-attached microtubules. This tug-of-war resulted in chromosome-specific segregation errors during anaphase and revealed that spindle forces can heavily stretch chromosomal arms. By single-cell whole-genome sequencing, we established that kinesin-induced targeted mis-segregations predominantly result in chromosomal arm aneuploidies after a single cell division. Our kinesin-based strategy opens the possibility to investigate the immediate cellular responses to specific aneuploidies in different cell types; an important step toward understanding how tissue-specific aneuploidy patterns evolve.",

When these different tumors originate and how they evolve are not known. Here we quantify the somatic evolution of neuroblastoma by deep whole-genome sequencing, molecular clock analysis and population-genetic modeling in a comprehensive cohort covering all subtypes. We find that tumors across the entire clinical spectrum begin to develop via aberrant mitoses as early as the first trimester of pregnancy. Neuroblastomas with favorable prognosis expand clonally after short evolution, whereas aggressive neuroblastomas show prolonged evolution during which they acquire telomere maintenance mechanisms. The initial aneuploidization events condition subsequent evolution, with aggressive neuroblastoma exhibiting early genomic instability. We find in the discovery cohort (n\u2009=\u2009100), and validate in an independent cohort (n\u2009=\u200986), that the duration of evolution is an accurate predictor of outcome. Thus, insight into neuroblastoma evolution may prospectively guide treatment decisions.",

			"abstract": "The causes of pediatric cancers' distinctiveness compared to adult-onset tumors of the same type are not completely clear and not fully explained by their genomes. In this study, we used an optimized multilevel RNA clustering approach to derive molecular definitions for most childhood cancers. Applying this method to 13,313 transcriptomes, we constructed a pediatric cancer atlas to explore age-associated changes. Tumor entities were sometimes unexpectedly grouped due to common lineages, drivers or stemness profiles. Some established entities were divided into subgroups that predicted outcome better than current diagnostic approaches. These definitions account for inter-tumoral and intra-tumoral heterogeneity and have the potential of enabling reproducible, quantifiable diagnostics. As a whole, childhood tumors had more transcriptional diversity than adult tumors, maintaining greater expression flexibility. To apply these insights, we designed an ensemble convolutional neural network classifier. We show that this tool was able to match or clarify the diagnosis for 85% of childhood tumors in a prospective cohort. If further validated, this framework could be extended to derive molecular definitions for all cancer types.",

			"abstract": "Histologically normal human tissues accumulate significant mutational burden with age. The extent and spectra of mutagenesis are comparable both in rapidly proliferating and post-mitotic tissues and in stem cells compared with their differentiated progeny. Some of these mutations provide increased fitness, giving rise to clones which, at times, can replace the entire surface area of tissues. Compared with cancer, somatic mutations in histologically normal tissues are primarily single-nucleotide variations. Interestingly though, the presence of these mutations and positive clonal selection in isolation remains a poor indicator of potential future cancer transformation in solid tissues. Common clonally expanded mutations in histologically normal tissues also do not always represent the most frequent early mutations in cancers of corresponding tissues, indicating differences in selection pressures. Preliminary evidence implies that stroma and immune system co-evolve with age, which may impact selection dynamics. In this review, we will explore the mutational landscape of histologically normal and premalignant human somatic tissues in detail and discuss cell-intrinsic and environmental factors that can determine the fate of positively selected mutations within them. Precisely pinpointing these determinants of cancer transformation would aid development of early cancer interventional and prevention strategies.",

			"abstract": "Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive cancer with rising incidence and challenging clinical management. Through a large series of whole-genome sequencing data, integrated with transcriptomic and epigenomic data using multiomics factor analysis, we demonstrate that the current World Health Organization classification only accounts for up to 10% of interpatient molecular differences. Instead, the MESOMICS project paves the way for a morphomolecular classification of MPM based on four dimensions: ploidy, tumor cell morphology, adaptive immune response and CpG island methylator profile. We show that these four dimensions are complementary, capture major interpatient molecular differences and are delimited by extreme phenotypes that-in the case of the interdependent tumor cell morphology and adapted immune response-reflect tumor specialization. These findings unearth the interplay between MPM functional biology and its genomic history, and provide insights into the variations observed in the clinical behavior of patients with MPM.",

			"abstract": "Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) play a central role in tumourigenesis with recurrent activating mutations of its p110\u03b1 subunit (PIK3CA) identified in several tumours. Although several PI3K inhibitors are approved for haematological malignancies, only alpelisib was approved in solid tumours and for the treatment of PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) syndrome. Traditional PI3K inhibitors inhibit both wild-type and mutant PI3K with almost equal potency, thus limiting their efficacy due to on-target toxicity. Since the initiation of phase I clinical trials investigating next generation allosteric mutant and isoform selective PIK3CA inhibitors, there has been a surge in interest in PIK3CA targeting in solid tumours. Preclinical characterisation of these compounds showed that maximal mutant protein inhibition fails to elicit metabolic and glucose homoeostasis dysregulation, one of the dose limiting toxicities of both selective and pan PI3K inhibitors. While extreme selectivity can be hypothesised to grant activity and safety advantage to these novel agents, on the other hand reduced benefit can be speculated for patients harbouring multiple or rare PIK3CA mutations. This review summarises the current understanding of PI3K alterations and the state-of-the-art treatment strategies in PI3K driven solid tumours, while also exploring the potential intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms to these agents, and the emerging role of mutant selective PIK3CA inhibitors.",

			"abstract": "Spatial properties of tumour growth have profound implications for cancer progression, therapeutic resistance and metastasis. Yet, how spatial position governs tumour cell division remains difficult to evaluate in clinical tumours. Here, we demonstrate that faster division on the tumour periphery leaves characteristic genetic patterns, which become evident when a phylogenetic tree is reconstructed from spatially sampled cells. Namely, rapidly dividing peripheral lineages branch more extensively and acquire more mutations than slower-dividing centre lineages. We develop a Bayesian state-dependent evolutionary phylodynamic model (SDevo) that quantifies these patterns to infer the differential division rates between peripheral and central cells. We demonstrate that this approach accurately infers spatially varying birth rates of simulated tumours across a range of growth conditions and sampling strategies. We then show that SDevo outperforms state-of-the-art, non-cancer multi-state phylodynamic methods that ignore differential sequence evolution. Finally, we apply SDevo to single-time-point, multi-region sequencing data from clinical hepatocellular carcinomas and find evidence of a three- to six-times-higher division rate on the tumour edge. With the increasing availability of high-resolution, multi-region sequencing, we anticipate that SDevo will be useful in interrogating spatial growth restrictions and could be extended to model non-spatial factors that influence tumour progression.",

In my opinion, the evolutionary gene network theory is the only theory that can satisfactorily explain the homologies between carcinogenesis, tumorigenesis, metastasis, gametogenesis, and early embryogenesis.

			"abstract": "Clonal hematopoiesis (CH), in which hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) clones and their progeny expand in the circulating blood cell population, occurs following the acquisition of somatic driver mutations. Individuals diagnosed with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) carry somatic mutations in hematological malignancy-associated driver genes, historically at or above a variant allele frequency of 2%, but do not exhibit abnormal blood cell counts or any other symptoms of hematologic disease. However, CHIP is associated with moderately increased risk of hematological cancer and a greater likelihood of cardiovascular and pulmonary disease. Recent advances in the resolution of high-throughput sequencing experiments suggest CHIP is much more prevalent in the population than once thought, particularly among those aged 60 and over. Although CHIP does elevate the risk of eventual hematological malignancy, only one in 10 individuals with CHIP will receive such a diagnosis; the problem lies in the continued difficulty in accurately separating the 10% of CHIP patients who are most likely to be in a premalignant state from those who are not, given the heterogeneity of this condition and the etiology of the associated hematological cancers. Concerns over the risk of eventual malignancies must be balanced with growing recognition of CH as a common age-dependent occurrence, and efforts to better characterize and differentiate oncogenic clonal expansion from that which is much more benign. In this review, we discuss evolutionary dynamics of CH and CHIP, the relationship of CH to aging and inflammation, and the role of the epigenome in promoting potentially pathogenic or benign cellular trajectories. We outline molecular mechanisms that may contribute to heterogeneity in the etiology of CHIP and the incidence of malignant disease among individuals. Finally, we discuss epigenetic markers and modifications for CHIP detection and monitoring with the potential for translational applications and clinical utility in the near future.",

Dubbed as the cell adaptive fitness, the proposition postulates that the coupling between cell signaling and metabolism constrains cancer evolutionary dynamics along trajectories privileged by the maintenance of metabolic sufficiency for survival. In particular, the conjecture postulates that clonal expansion becomes restricted when genetic alterations induce a sufficiently high level of disorder, that is, high entropy, in the regulatory signaling network, abrogating as a result the ability of cancer cells to successfully replicate, leading to a stage of clonal stagnation. The proposition is analyzed in the context of an in-silico model of tumor evolutionary dynamics to illustrate how cell-inherent adaptive fitness may predictably constrain clonal evolution of tumors, which would have significant implications for the design of adaptive cancer therapies.",

Genomic/epigenomic and transcriptomic alterations are inter-related between genes, within and across cancer types and may affect clinical phenotypes. Despite the abundant prior studies of integrating cancer multi-omics data, none of them organizes these associations in a hierarchical structure and validates the discoveries in extensive external data. We infer this Integrated Hierarchical Association Structure (IHAS) from the complete data of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and compile a compendium of cancer multi-omics associations. Intriguingly, diverse alterations on genomes/epigenomes from multiple cancer types impact transcriptions of 18 Gene Groups. Half of them are further reduced to three Meta Gene Groups enriched with (1) immune and inflammatory responses, (2) embryonic development and neurogenesis, (3) cell cycle process and DNA repair. Over 80% of the clinical/molecular phenotypes reported in TCGA are aligned with the combinatorial expressions of Meta Gene Groups, Gene Groups, and other IHAS subunits. Furthermore, IHAS derived from TCGA is validated in more than 300 external datasets including multi-omics measurements and cellular responses upon drug treatments and gene perturbations in tumors, cancer cell lines, and normal tissues. To sum up, IHAS stratifies patients in terms of molecular signatures of its subunits, selects targeted genes or drugs for precision cancer therapy, and demonstrates that associations between survival times and transcriptional biomarkers may vary with cancer types. These rich information is critical for diagnosis and treatments of cancers.",

			"abstract": "Tumour progression is modulated by the local microenvironment. This environment is populated by many immune cells, of which macrophages are among the most abundant. Clinical correlative data and a plethora of preclinical studies in mouse models of cancers have shown that tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a cancer-promoting role. Within the primary tumour, TAMs promote tumour cell invasion and intravasation and tumour stem cell viability and induce angiogenesis. At the metastatic site, metastasis-associated macrophages promote extravasation, tumour cell survival and persistent growth, as well as maintain tumour cell dormancy in some contexts. In both the primary and metastatic sites, TAMs are suppressive to the activities of cytotoxic T and natural killer cells that have the potential to eradicate tumours. Such activities suggest that TAMs will be a major target for therapeutic intervention. In this Perspective article, we chronologically explore the evolution of our understanding of TAM biology put into the context of major enabling advances in macrophage biology.",

			"abstract": "Recently, distinct mutational footprints observed in metastatic tumors, secondary malignancies and normal human tissues have been demonstrated to be caused by the exposure to several chemotherapeutic drugs. These characteristic mutations originate from specific lesions caused by these chemicals to the DNA of exposed cells. However, it is unknown whether the exposure to these chemotherapies leads to a specific footprint of larger chromosomal aberrations. Here, we address this question exploiting whole genome sequencing data of metastatic tumors obtained from patients exposed to different chemotherapeutic drugs. As a result, we discovered a specific copy number footprint across tumors from patients previously exposed to platinum-based therapies. This footprint is characterized by a significant increase in the number of chromosomal fragments of copy number 1-4 and size smaller than 10 Mb in exposed tumors with respect to their unexposed counterparts (median 14-387% greater across tumor types). The number of chromosomal fragments characteristic of the platinum-associated CN footprint increases significantly with the activity of the well known platinum-related footprint of single nucleotide variants across exposed tumors.",

Consequently, more than 40 compounds targeting key components of this signalling network have been tested in clinical trials among various types of cancer. As the oncogenic activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway often occurs alongside mutations in other signalling networks, combination therapy should be considered.

			"abstract": "Brain metastases (BMs) often occur in patients with lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma and are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. The incidence of BM has increased with advanced neuroimaging and prolonged overall survival of cancer patients. With the advancement of local treatment modalities, including stereotactic radiosurgery and navigation-guided microsurgery, BM can be controlled long-term, even in cases with multiple lesions. However, radiation/chemotherapeutic agents are also toxic to the brain, usually irreversibly and cumulatively, and it remains difficult to completely cure BM. Thus, we must understand the molecular events that begin and sustain BM to develop effective targeted therapies and tools to prevent local and distant treatment failure. BM most often spreads hematogenously, and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) presents the first hurdle for disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) entering the brain parenchyma. Nevertheless, how the DTCs cross the BBB and settle on relatively infertile central nervous system tissue remains unknown. Even after successfully taking up residence in the brain, the unique tumor microenvironment is marked by restricted aerobic glycolysis metabolism and limited lymphocyte infiltration. Brain organotropism, certain phenotype of primary cancers that favors brain metastasis, may result from somatic mutation or epigenetic modulation. Recent studies revealed that exosome secretion from primary cancer or over-expression of proteolytic enzymes can \"pre-condition\" brain vasculoendothelial cells. The concept of the \"metastatic niche,\" where resident DTCs remain dormant and protected from systemic chemotherapy and antigen exposure before proliferation, is supported by clinical observation of BM in patients clearing systemic cancer and experimental evidence of the interaction between cancer cells and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. This review examines extant research on the metastatic cascade of BM through the molecular events that create and sustain BM to reveal clues that can assist the development of effective targeted therapies that treat established BMs and prevent BM recurrence.",

Novel statistical and algorithmic approaches are now at the center of scientific work, showing that work that is considered marginal in one era can become a mainstream research approach in the next era. The onset of data-driven science caused a shift from hypothesis-testing to hypothesis-generating approaches in science.

			"abstract": "Genome variation is the direct cause of cancer and driver of its clonal evolution. While the impact of many point mutations can be evaluated through their modification of individual genomic elements, even a single copy number aberration (CNA) may encompass hundreds of genes and therefore pose challenges to untangle potentially complex functional effects. However, consistent, recurring and disease-specific patterns in the genome-wide CNA landscape imply that particular CNA may promote cancer-type-specific characteristics. Discerning essential cancer-promoting alterations from the inherent co-dependency in CNA would improve the understanding of mechanisms of CNA and provide new insights into cancer biology and potential therapeutic targets. Here we implement a model using segmental breakpoints to discover non-random gene coverage by copy number deletion (CND). With a diverse set of cancer types from multiple resources, this model identified common and cancer-type-specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes as well as cancer-promoting functional pathways. Confirmed by differential expression analysis of data from corresponding cancer types, the results show that for most cancer types, despite dissimilarity of their CND landscapes, similar canonical pathways are affected. In 25 analyses of 17 cancer types, we have identified 19 to 169 significant genes by copy deletion, including RB1, PTEN and CDKN2A as the most significantly deleted genes among all cancer types. We have also shown a shared dependence on core pathways for cancer progression in different cancers as well as cancer type separation by genome-wide significance scores. While this work provides a reference for gene specific significance in many cancers, it chiefly contributes a general framework to derive genome-wide significance and molecular insights in CND profiles with a potential for the analysis of rare cancer types as well as non-coding regions.",

			"abstract": "The goal of cancer screening is to detect disease at an early stage when treatment may be more effective. Cancer screening in dogs has relied upon annual physical examinations and routine laboratory tests, which are largely inadequate for detecting preclinical disease. With the introduction of non-invasive liquid biopsy cancer detection methods, the discussion is shifting from how to screen dogs for cancer to when to screen dogs for cancer. To address this question, we analyzed data from 3,452 cancer-diagnosed dogs to determine the age at which dogs of certain breeds and weights are typically diagnosed with cancer. In our study population, the median age at cancer diagnosis was 8.8 years, with males diagnosed at younger ages than females, and neutered dogs diagnosed at significantly later ages than intact dogs. Overall, weight was inversely correlated with age at cancer diagnosis, and purebred dogs were diagnosed at significantly younger ages than mixed-breed dogs. For breeds represented by \u226510 dogs, a breed-based median age at diagnosis was calculated. A weight-based linear regression model was developed to predict the median age at diagnosis for breeds represented by \u226410 dogs and for mixed-breed dogs. Our findings, combined with findings from previous studies which established a long duration of the preclinical phase of cancer development in dogs, suggest that it might be reasonable to consider annual cancer screening starting 2 years prior to the median age at cancer diagnosis for dogs of similar breed or weight. This logic would support a general recommendation to start cancer screening for all dogs at the age of 7, and as early as age 4 for breeds with a lower median age at cancer diagnosis, in order to increase the likelihood of early detection and treatment.",

To circumvent this, our group has previously optimized fluorescence-activated cell sorting to purify HRS cells. Using this approach, we now report the whole-genome sequencing landscape of HRS cells and reconstruct the chronology and likely etiology of pathogenic events leading to cHL. We identified alterations in driver genes not previously described in cHL, APOBEC mutational activity, and the presence of complex structural variants including chromothripsis. We found that high ploidy in cHL is often acquired through multiple, independent chromosomal gains events including whole-genome duplication. Evolutionary timing analyses revealed that structural variants enriched for RAG motifs, driver mutations in B2M, BCL7A, GNA13, and PTPN1, and the onset of AID-driven mutagenesis usually preceded large chromosomal gains. This study provides a temporal reconstruction of cHL pathogenesis.",

In this review, we propose that the molecular effectors of senescence, particularly the inactivation of TP53 and CDKN2A, together with telomere attrition and telomerase activation, all lead to aneuploidy in the keratinocytes from oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD). Premalignant keratinocytes, therefore, not only become immortal but also develop genotypic and phenotypic cellular diversity. As a result of these changes, certain clonal cell populations likely gain the capacity to invade the underlying connective tissue. We review the clinical implications of these changes and highlight a new PCR-based assay to identify aneuploid cell in fluids such as saliva, a technique that is extremely sensitive and could facilitate the regular monitoring of OPMD without the need for surgical biopsies and may avoid potential biopsy sampling errors. We also draw attention to recent studies designed to eliminate aneuploid tumour cell populations that, potentially, is a new therapeutic approach to prevent malignant transformations in OPMD.",

			"abstract": "Quantitative differences in signal transduction are to date an understudied feature of tumour heterogeneity. The MAPK Erk pathway, which is activated in a large proportion of human tumours, is a prototypic example of distinct cell fates being driven by signal intensity. We have used primary hepatocyte precursors transformed with different dosages of an oncogenic form of Ras to model subclonal variations in MAPK signalling. Orthotopic allografts of Ras-transformed cells in immunocompromised mice gave rise to fast-growing aggressive tumours, both at the primary location and in the peritoneal cavity. Fluorescent labelling of cells expressing different oncogene levels, and consequently varying levels of MAPK Erk activation, highlighted the selection processes operating at the two sites of tumour growth. Indeed, significantly higher Ras expression was observed in primary as compared to secondary, metastatic sites, despite the apparent evolutionary trade-off of increased apoptotic death in the liver that correlated with high Ras dosage. Analysis of the immune tumour microenvironment at the two locations suggests that fast peritoneal tumour growth in the immunocompromised setting is abrogated in immunocompetent animals due to efficient antigen presentation by peritoneal dendritic cells. Furthermore, our data indicate that, in contrast to the metastatic-like outgrowth, strong MAPK signalling is required in the primary liver tumours to resist elimination by NK (natural killer) cells. Overall, this study describes a quantitative aspect of tumour heterogeneity and points to a potential vulnerability of a subtype of hepatocellular carcinoma as a function of MAPK Erk signalling intensity.",

			"abstract": "Patients treated with cytotoxic therapies, including autologous stem cell transplantation, are at risk for developing therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (tMN). Preleukemic clones (ie, clonal hematopoiesis [CH]) are detectable years before the development of these aggressive malignancies, although the genomic events leading to transformation and expansion are not well defined. Here, by leveraging distinctive chemotherapy-associated mutational signatures from whole-genome sequencing data and targeted sequencing of prechemotherapy samples, we reconstructed the evolutionary life-history of 39 therapy-related myeloid malignancies. A dichotomy was revealed, in which neoplasms with evidence of chemotherapy-induced mutagenesis from platinum and melphalan were hypermutated and enriched for complex structural variants (ie, chromothripsis), whereas neoplasms with nonmutagenic chemotherapy exposures were genomically similar to de novo acute myeloid leukemia. Using chemotherapy-associated mutational signatures as temporal barcodes linked to discrete clinical exposure in each patient's life, we estimated that several complex events and genomic drivers were acquired after chemotherapy was administered. For patients with prior multiple myeloma who were treated with high-dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplantation, we demonstrate that tMN can develop from either a reinfused CH clone that escapes melphalan exposure and is selected after reinfusion, or from TP53-mutant CH that survives direct myeloablative conditioning and acquires melphalan-induced DNA damage. Overall, we revealed a novel mode of tMN progression that is not reliant on direct mutagenesis or even exposure to chemotherapy. Conversely, for tMN that evolve under the influence of chemotherapy-induced mutagenesis, distinct chemotherapies not only select preexisting CH but also promote the acquisition of recurrent genomic drivers.",

Tissue biopsy is specific but invasive and may have severe side effects, and therefore is inappropriate for screening of the disease. At the same time, the PSA blood test, which is conventionally used for PCa screening, has low specificity and may be elevated in the case of noncancerous prostate tumors and inflammatory conditions, including benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis. Thus, diverse techniques of liquid biopsy have been investigated to supplement or replace the existing tests of prostate cancer early diagnosis and prognostics.

A range of new spatial genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic technologies offers new avenues for the study of cancer evolution with great molecular and spatial detail.

			"abstract": "Precision oncology research is challenging outside the contexts of oncogenic addiction and/or targeted therapies. We previously showed that phosphoproteomics is a powerful approach to reveal patient subsets of interest characterized by the activity of a few kinases where the underlying genomics is complex. Here, we conduct a phosphoproteomic screening of samples from HER2-negative female breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant paclitaxel (N\u2009=\u2009130), aiming to find candidate biomarkers of paclitaxel sensitivity. Filtering 11 candidate biomarkers through 2 independent patient sets (N\u2009=\u2009218) allowed the identification of a subgroup of patients characterized by high levels of CDK4 and filamin-A who had a 90% chance of achieving a pCR in response to paclitaxel. Mechanistically, CDK4 regulates filamin-A transcription, which in turn forms a complex with tubulin and CLIP-170, which elicits increased binding of paclitaxel to microtubules, microtubule acetylation and stabilization, and mitotic catastrophe. Thus, phosphoproteomics allows the identification of explainable factors for predicting response to paclitaxel.",

			"abstract": "Identifying the interrelations among cancer driver genes and the patterns in which the driver genes get mutated is critical for understanding cancer. In this paper, we study cross-sectional data from cohorts of tumors to identify the cancer-type (or subtype) specific process in which the cancer driver genes accumulate critical mutations. We model this mutation accumulation process using a tree, where each node includes a driver gene or a set of driver genes. A mutation in each node enables its children to have a chance of mutating. This model simultaneously explains the mutual exclusivity patterns observed in mutations in specific cancer genes (by its nodes) and the temporal order of events (by its edges). We introduce a computationally efficient dynamic programming procedure for calculating the likelihood of our noisy datasets and use it to build our Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference algorithm, ToMExO. Together with a set of engineered MCMC moves, our fast likelihood calculations enable us to work with datasets with hundreds of genes and thousands of tumors, which cannot be dealt with using available cancer progression analysis methods. We demonstrate our method's performance on several synthetic datasets covering various scenarios for cancer progression dynamics. Then, a comparison against two state-of-the-art methods on a moderate-size biological dataset shows the merits of our algorithm in identifying significant and valid patterns. Finally, we present our analyses of several large biological datasets, including colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, and pancreatic cancer. In all the analyses, we validate the results using a set of method-independent metrics testing the causality and significance of the relations identified by ToMExO or competing methods.",

			"abstract": "Cancer genomes harbor a catalog of somatic mutations. The type and genomic context of these mutations depend on their causes and allow their attribution to particular mutational signatures. Previous work has shown that mutational signature activities change over the course of tumor development, but investigations of genomic region variability in mutational signatures have been limited. Here, we expand upon this work by constructing regional profiles of mutational signature activities over 2,203 whole genomes across 25 tumor types, using data aggregated by the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) consortium. We present GenomeTrackSig as an extension to the TrackSig R package to construct regional signature profiles using optimal segmentation and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We find that 426 genomes from 20 tumor types display at least one change in mutational signature activities (changepoint), and 306 genomes contain at least one of 54 recurrent changepoints shared by seven or more genomes of the same tumor type. Five recurrent changepoint locations are shared by multiple tumor types. Within these regions, the particular signature changes are often consistent across samples of the same type and some, but not all, are characterized by signatures associated with subclonal expansion. The changepoints we found cannot strictly be explained by gene density, mutation density, or cell-of-origin chromatin state. We hypothesize that they reflect a confluence of factors including evolutionary timing of mutational processes, regional differences in somatic mutation rate, large-scale changes in chromatin state that may be tissue type-specific, and changes in chromatin accessibility during subclonal expansion. These results provide insight into the regional effects of DNA damage and repair processes, and may help us localize genomic and epigenomic changes that occur during cancer development.",

Using the comprehensive resolution of whole genome sequencing (WGS) in 14 CD19-selected primary WM samples; comparing clonal and subclonal mutations revealed that germinal center (GC) mutational signatures SBS9 (poly-eta) and SBS84 (AID) have sustained activity, suggesting that the interaction between WM and the GC continues over time. Expanding our cohort size with 33 targeted sequencing samples, we interrogated the WM copy number aberration (CNA) landscape and chronology. Of interest, CNA prevalence progressively increased in symptomatic WM and relapsed disease when compared with stable precursor stages, with stable precursors lacking genomic complexity. Two MYD88 wild-type WGS contained a clonal gain affecting chromosome 12, which is typically an early event in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Molecular time analysis demonstrated that both chromosomal 12 gain events occurred early in cancer development whereas other CNA changes tend to occur later in the disease course and are often subclonal. In summary, WGS analysis in WM allows the demonstration of sustained GC activity over time and allows the reconstruction of the temporal evolution of specific genomic features. In addition, our data suggest that, although MYD88-mutations are central to WM clone establishment and can be observed in precursor disease, CNA may contribute to later phases, and may be used as a biomarker for progression risk from precursor conditions to symptomatic disease.",

			"abstract": "As a cancer develops, its cells accrue new mutations, resulting in a heterogeneous, complex genomic profile. We make use of this heterogeneity to derive simple, analytic estimates of parameters driving carcinogenesis and reconstruct the timeline of selective events following initiation of an individual cancer, where two longitudinal samples are available for sequencing. Using stochastic computer simulations of cancer growth, we show that we can accurately estimate mutation rate, time before and after a driver event occurred, and growth rates of both initiated cancer cells and subsequently appearing subclones. We demonstrate that in order to obtain accurate estimates of mutation rate and timing of events, observed mutation counts should be corrected to account for clonal mutations that occurred after the founding of the tumor, as well as sequencing coverage. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which often does not require treatment for years after diagnosis, presents an optimal system to study the untreated, natural evolution of cancer cell populations. When we apply our methodology to reconstruct the individual evolutionary histories of CLL patients, we find that the parental leukemic clone typically appears within the first fifteen years of life.",

			"abstract": "Smoking is a widely recognized risk factor in the emergence of cancers and other lung diseases. Studies of non-cancer lung diseases typically investigate the role that smoking has in chronic changes in lungs that might predispose patients to the diseases, whereas most cancer studies focus on the mutagenic properties of smoking. Large-scale cancer analysis efforts have collected expression data from both tumor and control lung tissues, and studies have used control samples to estimate the impact of smoking on gene expression. However, such analyses may be confounded by tumor-related micro-environments as well as patient-specific exposure to smoking. Thus, in this paper, we explore the utilization of mutational signatures to study environment-induced changes of gene expression in control lung tissues from lung adenocarcinoma samples. We show that a joint computational analysis of mutational signatures derived from sequenced tumor samples, and the gene expression obtained from control samples, can shed light on the combined impact that smoking and tumor-related micro-environments have on gene expression and cell-type composition in non-neoplastic (control) lung tissue. The results obtained through such analysis are both supported by experimental studies, including studies utilizing single-cell technology, and also suggest additional novel insights. We argue that the study provides a proof of principle of the utility of mutational signatures to be used as sensors of environmental exposures not only in the context of the mutational landscape of cancer, but also as a reference for changes in non-cancer lung tissues. It also provides an example of how a database collected with the purpose of understanding cancer can provide valuable information for studies not directly related to the disease.",

Meta-analyses across cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (n = 7,965) revealed that higher PRS values were associated with earlier cancer onset and lower burden of somatic alterations, including total mutations, chromosome/arm somatic copy-number alterations (SCNA), and focal SCNAs. This contrasts with rare germline pathogenic variants (e.g., BRCA1/2 variants), showing heterogeneous associations with somatic alterations.

The APOBEC3-mediated signatures are often detected in subclonal branches of tumor phylogenies and are acquired in cancer cell lines over long periods of time, indicating that APOBEC3 mutagenesis can be ongoing in cancer. Collectively, these and other observations have led to the proposal that APOBEC3 mutagenesis represents a disease-modifying process that could be inhibited to limit tumor heterogeneity, metastasis and drug resistance.

We then prospectively compared the mutation profiles of urine-extracted DNA to those of matched tumor tissue to validate clinical performance.

Finally, we retrospectively explored longitudinal case studies to quantify residual disease following bladder-sparing treatments, and found uCGP detected residual disease in patients receiving bladder-sparing treatment and predicted recurrence and disease progression. These findings demonstrate the potential of the UroAmplitude platform to reliably identify and track mutations associated with UC at each stage of disease: diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance.

Single-cell RNA transcription analysis was applied to compare the expression of UPP1 in tumor tissues and adjacent tissue. In vitro gain- and loss-of-function experiments with LUAD cells were performed to elucidate the functions of UPP1. Western blotting, qRT-PCR, cell apoptosis, IHC staining, Seahorse XF24 Extracellular Flux analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, and bioinformatics analysis were performed to reveal the underlying mechanisms. In this study, UPP1 was found to be the top metabolism-related gene that was upregulated by single-cell transcriptomic profiling of LUAD. Next, we confirmed that UPP1 was highly expressed in LUAD tissues and cell lines and was correlated with poor overall survival in LUAD patients. UPP1 drove glycolytic metabolism and significantly regulated the sensitivity of tumors to glycolytic inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. UPP1 is subject to epigenetic regulation through histone acetylation. The CBP/p300 inhibitor SGC-CBP30 reduced the protein levels of UPP1, H3K27ac, and H3K9ac. ChIP assays revealed that acetyl-histone H3 and RNA polymerase II bind to the UPP1 promoter. UPP1 overexpression restored lactic acid production and glucose uptake compared to the SGC-CBP30 group.

We report a method that uses a generalized additive model to investigate the breakpoint proximity curves from 2,382 whole-genomes of 32 cancer types. We find that a multivariate model, which includes linear and nonlinear partial contributions of various tissue-specific features and their interaction terms, can explain up to 57% of the observed deviance of breakpoint proximity. In particular, three-dimensional genomic features such as topologically associating domains (TADs), TAD-boundaries and their interaction with other features show significant contributions. The model is validated by identification of known cancer genes and revealed putative drivers in cancers different than those with previous evidence of positive selection.",

Although traditionally regarded as difficult to drug, several new strategies have recently become available for targeting the mutant protein. One of the most promising of these involves the use of low molecular weight compounds that promote refolding and reactivation of mutant p53 to its wild-type form. Several such reactivating drugs are currently undergoing evaluation in clinical trials, including eprenetapopt (APR-246), COTI-2, arsenic trioxide and PC14586. Of these, the most clinically advanced for targeting mutant p53 is eprenetapopt which has completed phase I, II and III clinical trials, the latter in patients with mutant ",

			"abstract": "Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type glioblastoma (GBM) has a dismal prognosis. A better understanding of tumor evolution holds the key to developing more effective treatment. Here we study GBM's natural evolutionary trajectory by using rare multifocal samples. We sequenced 61,062 single cells from eight multifocal IDH wild-type primary GBMs and defined a natural evolution signature (NES) of the tumor. We show that the NES significantly associates with the activation of transcription factors that regulate brain development, including MYBL2 and FOSL2. Hypoxia is involved in inducing NES transition potentially via activation of the HIF1A-FOSL2 axis. High-NES tumor cells could recruit and polarize bone marrow-derived macrophages through activation of the FOSL2-ANXA1-FPR1/3 axis. These polarized macrophages can efficiently suppress T-cell activity and accelerate NES transition in tumor cells. Moreover, the polarized macrophages could upregulate CCL2 to induce tumor cell migration.",

Cutaneous melanoma is associated with skin exposed to ultraviolet radiation; uveal melanoma occurs in the eyes; mucosal melanoma occurs in internal mucous membranes; and acral melanoma occurs on the palms, soles, and nail beds. Here, we present the largest whole-genome sequencing study of melanoma to date, with 570 tumors profiled, as well as methylation and RNA sequencing for subsets of tumors. Uveal melanoma is genomically distinct from other melanoma subtypes, harboring the lowest tumor mutation burden and with significantly mutated genes in the G-protein signaling pathway. Most cutaneous, acral, and mucosal melanomas share alterations in components of the MAPK, PI3K, p53, p16, and telomere pathways. However, the mechanism by which these pathways are activated or inactivated varies between melanoma subtypes. Additionally, we identify potential novel germline predisposition genes for some of the less common melanoma subtypes.",

A significant number of hepatocytes physiologically undergo polyploidization at a young age. Polyploidization of hepatocytes is enhanced with age and in a diseased liver. It is worth noting that polyploid hepatocytes can proliferate, in marked contrast to other types of polyploid cells, such as megakaryocytes and cardiac myocytes. Polyploid hepatocytes divide to maintain normal liver homeostasis and play a role in the regeneration of the damaged liver. Furthermore, polyploid hepatocytes have been shown to dynamically reduce ploidy during liver regeneration. Although it is still unclear why hepatocytes undergo polyploidization, accumulating evidence has revealed that alterations in the ploidy in hepatocytes are involved in the pathophysiology of liver cirrhosis and carcinogenesis. This review discusses the significance of hepatocyte ploidy in physiological liver function, liver injury, and liver cancer.",

We performed targeted sequencing in 201 patients with ESCC to discover genetic subtypes and validate our findings via multiple data sets. We identified 3 driver genes (FCGBP, GRIN2B, and FRY), and recurrent truncating mutations in FRY impaired its tumor-suppressive function and promoted tumor proliferation. A 3-gene mutation signature (FAT1, FAT3, and FRY) recognized a molecular subtype named \"FAT/FRY\" with frequent Hippo pathway-related mutations. In multiple ESCC cohorts, the patients with the FAT/FRY subtype had poorer prognosis than did patients in the WT group. Transcriptome analysis indicated that the FAT/FRY subtype was characterized by inactivation of the Hippo pathway, hypoxia, chemoresistance, higher infiltration of CD8+ T cells and activated DCs, and a transcriptome similar to that of cancer responders. Furthermore, the 3-gene signature predicted better survival for patients treated with ICIs, partially explained by its positive correlation with the tumor mutation burden and neoantigen burden. The 3-gene signature is a biomarker to recognize the FAT/FRY molecular subtype, evaluate prognosis, and select potential beneficiaries of ICIs in ESCC.",

An individual's pay-off is dependent on the strategy of its opponent(s) as well as on its own, and the higher its pay-off, the higher its reproductive fitness. Its offspring generally inherit its interaction strategy, subject to random mutation. Over time, the composition of the population shifts as different strategies spread or are driven extinct. In the last 25 years there has been a flood of interest in applying EGT to cancer modelling, with the aim of explaining how cancerous mutations spread through healthy tissue and how intercellular cooperation persists in tumour-cell populations. This review traces this body of work from theoretical analyses of well-mixed infinite populations through to more realistic spatial models of the development of cooperation between epithelial cells. We also consider work in which EGT has been used to make experimental predictions about the evolution of cancer, and discuss work that remains to be done before EGT can make large-scale contributions to clinical treatment and patient outcomes.",

Therefore, extensive translational research efforts have been undertaken in recent years to gain further clinical and molecular insights. There is increasing evidence that the different clinical appearance of the CTCL subtypes derives from the assumption that they develop from different skin subpopulations of T\u00a0cells. Detection and quantification of the malignant T\u2011cell clones is crucial for the diagnosis and prognosis of CTCL. Numerous recurrent mutant cellular signalling pathways have been found in recent years. This includes the JAK-STAT, NF\u03baB, T\u2011cell receptor and MAP kinase signalling pathways, as well as cell cycle control and epigenetics. The most recent analyses imply a\u00a0tumour evolution model with initial copy number variation, like amplification or deletions of specific DNA fragments (CNVs) and only subsequent later single nucleotide variations (SNVs). The crucial question, however, is which CNVs are sufficient to initiate general tumourigenesis? The challenge is to identify possible driver genes. Increasing molecular understanding in CTCL will include new breakthrough therapeutic options in the near future.",

They are uniquely able to recapitulate embryonic and extraembryonic tissues, which carries prognostic and therapeutic significance. The developmental pathways underpinning GCT initiation and histogenesis are incompletely understood. Here, we study the relationship of histogenesis and clonal diversification in GCTs by analysing the genomes and transcriptomes of 547 microdissected histological units. We find no correlation between genomic and histological heterogeneity. However, we identify unifying features including the retention of fetal developmental transcripts across tissues, expression changes on chromosome 12p, and a conserved somatic evolutionary sequence of whole genome duplication followed by clonal diversification. While this pattern is preserved across all GCTs, the developmental timing of the duplication varies between prepubertal and postpubertal cases. In addition, tumours of younger children exhibit distinct substitution signatures which may lend themselves as potential biomarkers for risk stratification. Our findings portray the extensive diversification of GCT tissues and genetic subclones as randomly distributed, while identifying overarching transcriptional and genomic features.",

Here we use machine learning to model megabase-scale mutation burden in 2,500 whole cancer genomes and 17 cancer types via a compendium of 900 CA and RT profiles covering primary cancers, normal tissues, and cell lines. CA profiles of primary cancers, rather than those of normal tissues, are most predictive of regional mutagenesis in most cancer types. Feature prioritisation shows that the epigenomes of matching cancer types and organ systems are often the strongest predictors of regional mutation burden, highlighting disease-specific associations of mutational processes. The genomic distributions of mutational signatures are also shaped by the epigenomes of matched cancer and tissue types, with SBS5/40, carcinogenic and unknown signatures most accurately predicted by our models. In contrast, fewer associations of RT and regional mutagenesis are found. Lastly, the models highlight genomic regions with overrepresented mutations that dramatically exceed epigenome-derived expectations and show a pan-cancer convergence to genes and pathways involved in development and oncogenesis, indicating the potential of this approach for coding and non-coding driver discovery. The association of regional mutational processes with the epigenomes of primary cancers suggests that the landscape of passenger mutations is predominantly shaped by the epigenomes of cancer cells after oncogenic transformation.",

			"abstract": "Cancer becomes one of the main causes of human deaths in the world due to the high incidence and mortality rate and produces serious economic burdens. With more and more attention is paid on cancer, its therapies are getting more of a concern. Previous research has shown that the occurrence, progression, and treatment prognosis of malignant tumors are closely related to genetic and gene mutation. CRISPR/Cas9 has emerged as a powerful method for making changes to the genome, which has extensively been applied in various cell lines. Establishing the cell and animal models by CRISPR/Cas9 laid the foundation for the clinical trials which possibly treated the tumor. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing technology brings a great promise for inhibiting migration, invasion, and even treatment of tumor. However, the potential off-target effect limits its clinical application, and the effective ethical review is necessary. The article reviews the molecular mechanisms of CRISPR/Cas9 and discusses the research and the limitation related to cancer clinical trials.",

Hypermutability was associated with age and damaging mutations in genes implicated in cancers and, in some brains, reflected in vivo clonal expansions. Somatic duplications, likely arising during development, were found in ~5% of normal and diseased brains, reflecting background mutagenesis. Brains with autism were associated with mutations creating putative transcription factor binding motifs in enhancer-like regions in the developing brain.

Here, we present the Labyrinth-DEPArray pipeline for the isolation and analysis of single CTCs. Established cell lines, patient-derived CTC cell lines and freshly isolated CTCs were recovered and sequenced to reveal single-cell copy number variations (CNVs). The resulting CNV profiles of established cell lines showed concordance with previously reported data and highlight several gains and losses of cancer-related genes such as FGFR3 and GNAS. The novel sequencing of patient-derived CTC cell lines showed gains in chromosome 8q, 10q and 17q across both CTC cell lines. The pipeline was used to process and isolate single cells from a metastatic pancreatic cancer patient revealing a gain of chromosome 1q and a loss of chromosome 5q. Overall, the Labyrinth-DEPArray pipeline offers a validated workflow combining the benefits of antigen-free CTC isolation with single cell genomic analysis.",

By comparing this reference atlas to single-cell data from\u2009>100 glial tumours of the adult and paediatric human cerebrum, we find that tumour cells have an expression signature that overlaps with temporally restricted, embryonic radial glial precursors (RGPs) and their immediate sublineages. Further, we demonstrate that prenatal\u00a0transformation of RGPs in a genetic mouse model gives rise to adult cerebral tumours that show an embryonic/juvenile RGP identity. Together, these findings implicate the acquisition of embryonic-like states in the genesis of adult glioma, providing insight into the origins of human glioma, and identifying specific developmental cell types for therapeutic targeting.",

All generations of cancers carry somatic mutations, meanwhile, significant differences were observed in mutational signatures across tumors. Systematic sequencing of cancer genomes from patients after organ transplantation can reveal DNA damage and repair processes in exposed cancer cells and their precursors.

			"abstract": "From conception to death, human cells accumulate somatic mutations in their genomes. These mutations can contribute to the development of cancer and non-malignant diseases and have also been associated with aging. Rapid technological developments in sequencing approaches in the last few years and their application to normal tissues have greatly advanced our knowledge about the accumulation of these mutations during healthy aging. Whole genome sequencing studies have revealed that there are significant differences in mutation burden and patterns across tissues, but also that the mutation rates within tissues are surprisingly constant during adult life. In contrast, recent lineage-tracing studies based on whole-genome sequencing have shown that the rate of mutation accumulation is strongly increased early in life before birth. These early mutations, which can be shared by many cells in the body, may have a large impact on development and the origin of somatic diseases. For example, cancer driver mutations can arise early in life, decades before the detection of the malignancy. Here, we review the recent insights in mutation accumulation and mutagenic processes in normal tissues. We compare mutagenesis early and later in life and discuss how mutation rates and patterns evolve during aging. Additionally, we outline the potential impact of these mutations on development, aging and disease.",

			"abstract": "Cancer cell genomes change continuously due to mutations, and mutational processes change over time in patients, leaving dynamic signatures in the accumulated genomic variation in tumors. Many computational methods detect the relative activities of known mutation signatures. However, these methods may produce erroneous signatures when applied to individual branches in cancer cell phylogenies. Here, we show that the inference of branch-specific mutational signatures can be improved through a joint analysis of the collections of mutations mapped on proximal branches of the cancer cell phylogeny. This approach reduces the false-positive discovery rate of branch-specific signatures and can sometimes detect faint signatures. An analysis of empirical data from 61 lung cancer patients supports trends based on computer-simulated datasets for which the correct signatures are known. In lung cancer somatic variation, we detect a decreasing trend of smoking-related mutational processes over time and an increasing influence of APOBEC mutational processes as the tumor evolution progresses. These analyses also reveal patterns of conservation and divergence of mutational processes in cell lineages within patients.",

			"abstract": "Recent research on normal human tissues identified omnipresent clones of cells, driven by somatic mutations known to be responsible for carcinogenesis (e.g., in TP53 or NOTCH1). These new insights are fundamentally changing current tumor evolution models, with broad oncological implications. Most studies are based on surgical remnant tissues, which are not available for many organs and rarely in a pan-organ setting (multiple organs from the same individual). Here, we describe an approach based on clinically annotated post-mortem tissues, derived from whole-body donors that are routinely used for educational purposes at human anatomy units. We validated this post-mortem approach using UV-exposed and unexposed epidermal skin tissues and confirm the presence of positively selected NOTCH1/2-, TP53- and FAT1-driven clones. No selection signals were detected in a set of immune genes or housekeeping genes. Additionally, we provide the first evidence for smoking-induced clonal changes in oral epithelia, likely underlying the origin of head and neck carcinogenesis. In conclusion, the whole-body donor-based approach provides a nearly unlimited healthy tissue resource to study mutational clonality and gain fundamental mutagenic insights in the presumed earliest stages of tumor evolution.",

We estimate and validate TmS in 6,590 patient tumors across 15 cancer types, identifying significant inter-tumor variability. Across cancers, high TmS is associated with increased risk of disease progression and death. TmS is influenced by cancer-specific patterns of gene alteration and intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity as well as by pan-cancer trends in metabolic dysregulation.

We describe two enabling characteristics that play a major role in enabling cells to acquire the hallmarks of cancer - \"tumor-promoting microenvironment and macroenvironment\" and \"cancer epigenetics, genome instability and mutation.\"\u00a0We also discuss the recent updates, therapeutic and prognostic implications of the eight hallmarks of cancer described by Hanahan et al. in 2011. Understanding these hallmarks and enabling characteristics is key not only to developing new ways to treat cancer efficiently but also to exploring options to overcome cancer resistance to treatment.",

Although bulk tumor genomic analyses have provided some insight into these processes, single-cell sequencing has emerged as a powerful technique to profile individual cells in unprecedented detail. Since the introduction of single-cell RNA sequencing, we now have the capability to capture not only transcriptomic, but also genomic, epigenetic, and proteomic variation between single cells separately and in combination. This rapidly evolving field has the potential to transform our understanding of the fundamental biology of pediatric ALL and guide the management of ALL patients to improve their clinical outcome.

We describe a remarkable case of monozygotic twins presenting with CALR mutation-positive myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) (aged 37 and 38 years), with a clinical phenotype of primary myelofibrosis. The CALR mutation was absent in T cells and dermal fibroblasts, confirming somatic acquisition. Whole-genome sequencing lineage tracing revealed a common clonal origin of the CALR-mutant MPN clone, which occurred in utero followed by twin-to-twin transplacental transmission and subsequent similar disease latency. Index sorting and single-colony genotyping revealed phenotypic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) as the likely MPN-propagating cell. Furthermore, neonatal blood spot analysis confirmed in utero origin of the JAK2V617F mutation in a patient presenting with polycythemia vera (aged 34 years). These findings provide a unique window into the prolonged evolutionary dynamics of MPNs and fitness advantage exerted by MPN-associated driver mutations in HSCs.",

Here, we introduced an evolving lineage-tracing system with a single-cell RNA-seq readout into a mouse model of Kras;Trp53(KP)-driven lung adenocarcinoma and tracked tumor evolution from single-transformed cells to metastatic tumors at unprecedented resolution. We found that the loss of the initial, stable alveolar-type2-like state was accompanied by a transient increase in plasticity. This was followed by the adoption of distinct transcriptional programs that enable rapid expansion and, ultimately, clonal sweep of stable subclones capable of metastasizing. Finally, tumors develop through stereotypical evolutionary trajectories, and perturbing additional tumor suppressors accelerates progression by creating novel trajectories.

Here, we have developed and applied an ultrasensitive, single-molecule mutational test based on CRISPR-DS technology, which enables mutation detection at extremely low frequency (<0.001) in normal colon from patients with and without colorectal cancer. This testing platform revealed that normal colon from patients with and without colorectal cancer carries mutations in common colorectal cancer genes, but these mutations are more abundant in patients with cancer. Oncogenic KRAS mutations were observed in the normal colon of about one third of patients with colorectal cancer but in none of the patients without colorectal cancer. Patients with colorectal cancer also carried more TP53 mutations than patients without cancer and these mutations were more pathogenic and formed larger clones, especially in patients with early-onset colorectal cancer. Most mutations in the normal colon were different from the driver mutations in tumors, suggesting that the occurrence of independent clones with pathogenic KRAS and TP53 mutations is a common event in the colon of individuals who develop colorectal cancer. These results indicate that somatic evolution contributes to clonal expansions in the normal colon and that this process is enhanced in individuals with cancer, particularly in those with early-onset colorectal cancer.",

			"abstract": "The genome of each cell in the human body is constantly under assault from a plethora of exogenous and endogenous processes that can damage DNA. If not successfully repaired, DNA damage generally becomes permanently imprinted in cells, and all their progenies, as somatic mutations. In most cases, the patterns of these somatic mutations contain the tell-tale signs of the mutagenic processes that have imprinted and are termed mutational signatures. Recent pan-cancer genomic analyses have elucidated the compendium of mutational signatures for all types of small mutational events, including (1) single base substitutions, (2) doublet base substitutions, and (3) small insertions/deletions. In contrast to small mutational events, where, in most cases, DNA damage is a prerequisite, aneuploidy, which refers to the abnormal number of chromosomes in a cell, usually develops from mistakes during DNA replication. Such mistakes include DNA replication stress, mitotic errors caused by faulty microtubule dynamics, or cohesion defects that contribute to chromosomal breakage and can lead to copy number (CN) alterations (CNAs) or even to structural rearrangements. These aberrations also leave behind genomic scars which can be inferred from sequencing as CN signatures and rearrangement signatures. The analyses of mutational signatures of small mutational events have been extensively reviewed, so we will not comprehensively re-examine them here. Rather, our focus will be on summarising the existing knowledge for mutational signatures of CNAs. As studying CN signatures is an emerging field, we briefly summarise the utility that mutational signatures of small mutational events have provided in basic science, cancer treatment, and cancer prevention, and we emphasise the future role that CN signatures may play in each of these fields. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

Some of these mutants increase competitive fitness and may form clones that colonize the stem cell niche and persist to acquire further genome alterations.

Some positively selected mutants may promote cancer development, whereas others inhibit carcinogenesis. Factors that shape the mutational landscape include wild-type and mutant stem cell dynamics, competition for the niche, and environmental exposures.

Intrinsic chromosome mis-segregation rate, a measure of CIN, can inform prognosis and is a promising biomarker for response to anti-microtubule agents. However, existing methodologies to measure this rate are labor intensive, indirect, and confounded by selection against aneuploid cells, which reduces observable diversity. We developed a framework to measure CIN, accounting for karyotype selection, using simulations with various levels of CIN and models of selection. To identify the model parameters that best fit karyotype data from single-cell sequencing, we used approximate Bayesian computation to infer mis-segregation rates and karyotype selection. Experimental validation confirmed the extensive chromosome mis-segregation rates caused by the chemotherapy paclitaxel (18.5 \u00b1 0.5/division). Extending this approach to clinical samples revealed that inferred rates fell within direct observations of cancer cell lines. This work provides the necessary framework to quantify CIN in human tumors and develop it as a predictive biomarker.",

			"abstract": "Structural variants (SVs) represent a major source of aberration in tumour genomes. Given the diversity in the size and type of SVs present in tumours, the accurate detection and interpretation of SVs in tumours is challenging. New classes of complex structural events in tumours are discovered frequently, and the definitions of the genomic consequences of complex events are constantly being refined. Detailed analyses of short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from large tumour cohorts facilitate the interrogation of SVs at orders of magnitude greater scale and depth. However, the inherent technical limitations of short-read WGS prevent us from accurately detecting and investigating the impact of all the SVs present in tumours. The expanded use of long-read WGS will be critical for improving the accuracy of SV detection, and in fully resolving complex SV events, both of which are crucial for determining the impact of SVs on tumour progression and clinical outcome. Despite the present limitations, we demonstrate that SVs play an important role in tumourigenesis. In particular, SVs contribute significantly to late-stage tumour development and to intratumoural heterogeneity. The evolutionary trajectories of SVs represent a window into the clonal dynamics in tumours, a comprehensive understanding of which will be vital for influencing patient outcomes in the future. Recent findings have highlighted many clinical applications of SVs in cancer, from early detection to biomarkers for treatment response and prognosis. As the methods to detect and interpret SVs improve, elucidating the full breadth of the complex SV landscape and determining how these events modulate tumour evolution will improve our understanding of cancer biology and our ability to capitalise on the utility of SVs in the clinical management of cancer patients. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

			"abstract": "The healthy prostate is a relatively quiescent tissue. Yet, prostate epithelium overgrowth is a common condition during aging, associated with urinary dysfunction and tumorigenesis. For over thirty years, TGF-\u03b2 ligands have been known to induce cytostasis in a variety of epithelia, but the intracellular pathway mediating this signal in the prostate, and its relevance for quiescence, have remained elusive. Here, using mouse prostate organoids to model epithelial progenitors, we find that intra-epithelial non-canonical Activin A signaling inhibits cell proliferation in a Smad-independent manner. Mechanistically, Activin A triggers Tak1 and p38 \u039cAPK activity, leading to p16 and p21 nuclear import. Spontaneous evasion from this quiescent state occurs upon prolonged culture, due to reduced Activin A secretion, a condition associated with DNA replication stress and aneuploidy. Organoids capable to escape quiescence in vitro are also able to implant with increased frequency into immunocompetent mice. This study demonstrates that non-canonical Activin A signaling safeguards epithelial quiescence in the healthy prostate, with potential implications for the understanding of cancer initiation, and the development of therapies targeting quiescent tumor progenitors.",

			"abstract": "The availability of comprehensive genomic datasets across patient populations enables the application of novel methods for reconstructing tumor evolution within individual patients. To this end, we propose studying autosomal broad copy number alterations (CNAs) as a framework to better understand early tumor evolution. We compared the broad CNAs and somatic mutations of patients with 1 to 10 autosomal broad CNAs against the full set of patients, using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas breast cancer project. We reveal here that the frequency of a chromosome arm obtaining a broad CNA and a genome acquiring somatic mutations changes as autosomal broad CNAs accumulate. Therefore, we propose that the number of autosomal broad CNAs is an important characteristic of breast tumors that needs to be taken into consideration when studying breast tumors. To investigate this idea more in-depth, we next studied the frequency that specific chromosome arms acquire broad CNAs in patients with 1 to 10 broad CNAs. With this process, we identified the broad CNAs that exhibit the fastest rates of accumulation across all patients. This finding suggests a likely order of occurrence of these alterations in patients, which is apparent when we consider a subset of patients with few broad CNAs. Here, we lay the foundation for future studies to build upon our findings and use autosomal broad CNAs as a method to monitor breast tumor progression in vivo to further our understanding of how early tumor evolution unfolds.",

Pairtree is a new method that constructs more accurate and detailed clone trees than previously possible using variant allele frequency data from one or more bulk cancer samples. It does so by first building a Pairs Tensor that captures the evolutionary relationships between pairs of subpopulations, and then it uses these relations to constrain clone trees and infer violations of the infinite sites assumption. Pairtree can accurately build clone trees using up to 100 samples per cancer that contain 30 or more subclonal populations.

			"abstract": "Oral premalignant lesions (OPLs) are the precursors to oral cavity cancers, and have variable rates of progression to invasive disease. As an intermediate state, OPLs have acquired a subset of the genomic alterations while arising in an oral inflammatory environment. These specific genomic changes may facilitate the transition to an immune microenvironment that permits malignant transformation. Here, we will discuss mechanisms by which OPLs develop an immunosuppressive microenvironment that facilitates progression to invasive cancer. We will describe how genomic alterations and immune microenvironmental changes co-evolve and cooperate to promote OSCC progression. Finally, we will describe how these immune microenvironmental changes provide specific and unique evolutionary vulnerabilities for targeted therapies. Therefore, understanding the genomic changes that drive immunosuppressive microenvironments may eventually translate into novel biomarker and/or therapeutic approaches to limit the progression of OPLs to potential lethal oral cancers.",

This approach accurately classifies cancer types and provides spatially resolved tumor and normal tissue distinction. Automatically learned computational histopathological features correlate with a large range of recurrent genetic aberrations across cancer types. This includes whole-genome duplications, which display universal features across cancer types, individual chromosomal aneuploidies, focal amplifications and deletions, as well as driver gene mutations. There are widespread associations between bulk gene expression levels and histopathology, which reflect tumor composition and enable the localization of transcriptomically defined tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Computational histopathology augments prognosis based on histopathological subtyping and grading, and highlights prognostically relevant areas such as necrosis or lymphocytic aggregates.

We analysed rare CNVs in genes and non-coding regions for 86,788 breast cancer cases and 76,122 controls of European ancestry with genome-wide array data. Gene burden tests detected the strongest association for deletions in BRCA1 (P\u2009=\u20093.7E-18). Nine other genes were associated with a p-value\u2009<\u20090.01 including known susceptibility genes CHEK2 (P\u2009=\u20090.0008), ATM (P\u2009=\u20090.002) and BRCA2 (P\u2009=\u20090.008). Outside the known genes we detected associations with p-values\u2009<\u20090.001 for either overall or subtype-specific breast cancer at nine deletion regions and four duplication regions. Three of the deletion regions were in established common susceptibility loci. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first genome-wide analysis of rare CNVs in a large breast cancer case-control dataset. We detected associations with exonic deletions in established breast cancer susceptibility genes. We also detected suggestive associations with non-coding CNVs in known and novel loci with large effects sizes. Larger sample sizes will be required to reach robust levels of statistical significance.",

			"abstract": "Cancer is often called a disease of aging. There are numerous ways in which cancer epidemiology and behaviour change with the age of the patient. The molecular bases for these relationships remain largely underexplored. To characterise them, we analyse age-associations in the nuclear and mitochondrial somatic mutational landscape of 20,033 tumours across 35 tumour-types. Age influences both the number of mutations in a tumour (0.077 mutations per megabase per year) and their evolutionary timing. Specific mutational signatures are associated with age, reflecting differences in exogenous and endogenous oncogenic processes such as a greater influence of tobacco use in the tumours of younger patients, but higher activity of DNA damage repair signatures in those of older patients. We find that known cancer driver genes such as CDKN2A and CREBBP are mutated in age-associated frequencies, and these alter the transcriptome and predict for clinical outcomes. These effects are most striking in brain cancers where alterations like SUFU loss and ATRX mutation are age-dependent prognostic biomarkers. Using three cancer datasets, we show that age shapes the somatic mutational landscape of cancer, with clinical implications.",

			"abstract": "Over the past decade, a promising line of cancer research has utilized machine learning to mine statistical patterns of mutations in cancer genomes for information. Recent work shows that these statistical patterns, commonly referred to as \"mutational signatures,\" have diverse therapeutic potential as biomarkers for cancer therapies. However, translating this potential into reality is hindered by limited access to sequencing in the clinic. Almost all methods for mutational signature analysis (MSA) rely on whole genome or whole exome sequencing data, while sequencing in the clinic is typically limited to small gene panels. To improve clinical access to MSA, we considered the question of whether targeted panels could be designed for the purpose of mutational signature detection. Here we present ScalpelSig, to our knowledge the first algorithm that automatically designs genomic panels optimized for detection of a given mutational signature. The algorithm learns from data to identify genome regions that are particularly indicative of signature activity. Using a cohort of breast cancer genomes as training data, we show that ScalpelSig panels substantially improve accuracy of signature detection compared to baselines. We find that some ScalpelSig panels even approach the performance of whole exome sequencing, which observes over 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009as much genomic material. We test our algorithm under a variety of conditions, showing that its performance generalizes to another dataset of breast cancers, to smaller panel sizes, and to lesser amounts of training data.",

			"abstract": "The etiology of colorectal cancer (CRC) has been informed from both a molecular biology perspective, which concerns the study of the nature, timing, and consequences of mutations in driver genes, and epidemiology, which focuses on identifying risk factors for cancer. For the most part, these fields have developed independently, and it is thus important to consider them in a more integrated manner. The molecular mutational perspective has stressed the importance of mutations due to replication of adult stem cells, and the molecular fingerprint of most CRCs does not suggest the importance of direct carcinogens. Epidemiology has identified numerous modifiable risk factors that account for most CRCs, most of which are not direct mutagens. The distribution of CRCs across the large bowel is not uniform, which is possibly caused by regional differences in the microbiota. Some risk factors are likely to act through or interact with the microbiota. The mutational perspective informs when risk factors may begin to operate in life and when they may cease to operate. Evidence from the mutational model and epidemiology supports that CRC risk factors begin early in life and may contribute to the risk of early-onset CRC. Later in carcinogenesis, there may be a \"point of no return\" when sufficient mutations have accumulated, and some risk factors do not affect cancer risk. This period may be at least 5-15\u2009years for some risk factors. A more precise knowledge of timing of risk factor to cancer is required to inform preventive efforts.",

Sequencing studies have inferred various modes, including branching, punctuated and neutral evolution, but it is unclear why a particular pattern predominates in any given tumour. Here we propose that tumour architecture is key to explaining the variety of observed genetic patterns. We examine this hypothesis using spatially explicit population genetics models and demonstrate that, within biologically relevant parameter ranges, different spatial structures can generate four tumour evolutionary modes: rapid clonal expansion, progressive diversification, branching evolution and effectively almost neutral evolution. Quantitative indices for describing and classifying these evolutionary modes are presented. Using these indices, we show that our model predictions are consistent with empirical observations for cancer types with corresponding spatial structures. The manner of cell dispersal and the range of cell-cell interactions are found to be essential factors in accurately characterizing, forecasting and controlling tumour evolution.",

We examined co-expression changes in gene-network structure occurring during the onset and progression of nine different cancer types. Network complexity is generally reduced in the transition from normal precursor tissues to corresponding primary tumors. Cross-tissue cancer network similarity generally increases in early-stage cancers followed by a subsequent loss in cross-tissue cancer similarity as tumors reacquire cancer-specific network complexity. Gene-gene connections remaining stable through cancer development are enriched for \"housekeeping\" gene functions, whereas newly acquired interactions are associated with established cancer-promoting functions. Surprisingly, >90% of changes in gene-gene network interactions in cancers are not associated with changes in the expression of network genes relative to normal precursor tissues.",

			"abstract": "The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway plays a crucial role in various cellular processes and is aberrantly activated in cancers, contributing to the occurrence and progression of tumors. Examining the upstream and downstream nodes of this pathway could allow full elucidation of its function. Based on accumulating evidence, strategies targeting major components of the pathway might provide new insights for cancer drug discovery. Researchers have explored the use of some inhibitors targeting this pathway to block survival pathways. However, because oncogenic PI3K pathway activation occurs through various mechanisms, the clinical efficacies of these inhibitors are limited. Moreover, pathway activation is accompanied by the development of therapeutic resistance. Therefore, strategies involving pathway inhibitors and other cancer treatments in combination might solve the therapeutic dilemma. In this review, we discuss the roles of the PI3K/Akt pathway in various cancer phenotypes, review the current statuses of different PI3K/Akt inhibitors, and introduce combination therapies consisting of signaling inhibitors and conventional cancer therapies. The information presented herein suggests that cascading inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, either alone or in combination with other therapies, are the most effective treatment strategy for cancer.",

			"abstract": "Identifying precise molecular subtypes attributable to specific stages of localized prostate cancer has proven difficult due to high levels of heterogeneity. Bulk assays represent a population-average, which mask the heterogeneity that exists at the single-cell level. In this work, we sequence the accessible chromatin regions of 14,424 single-cells from 18 flash-frozen prostate tumours. We observe shared chromatin features among low-grade prostate cancer cells are lost in high-grade tumours. Despite this loss, high-grade tumours exhibit an enrichment for FOXA1, HOXB13 and CDX2 transcription factor binding sites, indicating a shared trans-regulatory programme. We identify two unique genes encoding neuronal adhesion molecules that are highly accessible in high-grade prostate tumours. We show NRXN1 and NLGN1 expression in epithelial, endothelial, immune and neuronal cells in prostate cancer using cyclic immunofluorescence. Our results provide a deeper understanding of the active gene regulatory networks in primary prostate tumours, critical for molecular stratification of the disease.",

			"abstract": "Ovarian malignancies are a leading cause of cancer-related death for US women. High-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOCs), the most common ovarian cancer subtype, are aggressive tumors with poor outcomes. Mutations in TP53 are common in HGSOCs, with a subset resulting in p53 aggregation and misregulation. ReACp53 is a peptide designed to inhibit mutant p53 aggregation and has been shown efficacious in targeting cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. As p53 regulates apoptosis, combining ReACp53 with carboplatin represents a logical therapeutic strategy. The efficacy of this combinatorial approach was tested in eight ovarian cancer cell lines and 10 patient HGSOC samples using an in vitro organoid drug assay, with the SynergyFinder tool utilized for calculating drug interactions. Results demonstrate that the addition of ReACp53 to carboplatin enhanced tumor cell targeting in the majority of samples tested, with synergistic effects measured in 2 samples, additivity measured in 14 samples, and antagonism measured in 1 sample. This combination was found to be synergistic in OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cells in vitro through enhanced apoptosis, and survival of mice bearing OVCAR3 intraperitoneal xenografts was extended when treated with the addition of ReACp53 to carboplatin versus carboplatin alone. Results suggest that carboplatin and ReACp53 may be a potential strategy in targeting a subset of HGSOCs.",

			"abstract": "Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous malignancy in which the genetic alterations determining clinical indications are not fully understood. Here, we performed a comprehensive whole-exome sequencing analysis of 152 primary samples derived from 134 MCL patients, including longitudinal samples from 16 patients and matched RNA-Seq data from 48 samples. We classified MCL into 4 robust clusters (C1-C4). C1 featured mutated immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV), CCND1 mutation, amp(11q13), and active B cell receptor (BCR) signaling. C2 was enriched with del(11q)/ATM mutations and upregulation of NF-\u03baB and DNA repair pathways. C3 was characterized by mutations in SP140, NOTCH1, and NSD2, with downregulation of BCR signaling and MYC targets. C4 harbored del(17p)/TP53 mutations, del(13q), and del(9p), and active MYC pathway and hyperproliferation signatures. Patients in these 4 clusters had distinct outcomes (5-year overall survival [OS] rates for C1-C4 were 100%, 56.7%, 48.7%, and 14.2%, respectively). We also inferred the temporal order of genetic events and studied clonal evolution of 16 patients before treatment and at progression/relapse. Eleven of these samples showed drastic clonal evolution that was associated with inferior survival, while the other samples showed modest or no evolution. Our study thus identifies genetic subsets that clinically define this malignancy and delineates clonal evolution patterns and their impact on clinical outcomes.",

			"abstract": "Spatial genetic and phenotypic diversity within solid tumors has been well documented. Nevertheless, how this heterogeneity affects temporal dynamics of tumorigenesis has not been rigorously examined because solid tumors do not evolve as the standard population genetic model due to the spatial constraint. We therefore, propose a neutral spatial (NS) model whereby the mutation accumulation increases toward the periphery; the genealogical relationship is spatially determined and the selection efficacy is blunted (due to kin competition). In this model, neutral mutations are accrued and spatially distributed in manners different from those of advantageous mutations. Importantly, the distinctions could be blurred in the conventional model. To test the NS model, we performed a three-dimensional multiple microsampling of two hepatocellular carcinomas. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) revealed a 2-fold increase in mutations going from the center to the periphery. The operation of natural selection can then be tested by examining the spatially determined clonal relationships and the clonal sizes. Due to limited migration, only the expansion of highly advantageous clones can sweep through a large part of the tumor to reveal the selective advantages. Hence, even multiregional sampling can only reveal a fraction of fitness differences in solid tumors. Our results suggest that the NS patterns are crucial for testing the influence of natural selection during tumorigenesis, especially for small solid tumors.",

Although inter-ethnic germline variation is known, differential somatic evolution has not been investigated in detail. Analysis of deep whole genomes of 97 breast cancers, with RNA-seq in a subset, from women in Nigeria in comparison with The Cancer Genome Atlas (n\u2009=\u200976) reveal a higher rate of genomic instability and increased intra-tumoral heterogeneity as well as a unique genomic subtype defined by early clonal GATA3 mutations with a 10.5-year younger age at diagnosis. We also find non-coding mutations in bona fide drivers (ZNF217 and SYPL1) and a previously unreported INDEL signature strongly associated with African ancestry proportion, underscoring the need to expand inclusion of diverse populations in biomedical research. Finally, we demonstrate that characterizing tumors for homologous recombination deficiency has significant clinical relevance in stratifying patients for potentially life-saving therapies.",

			"abstract": "Targeting solid tumors with absolute precision is a long-standing challenge in cancer immunotherapy. The identification of antigens, which are expressed by a large fraction of tumors of a given type and, preferably, across various types, but not by normal cells, holds the key to developing safe, off-the-shelf immunotherapies. Although the quest for widely shared, strictly tumor-specific antigens has been the focus of tremendous effort, only few such candidates have been implicated. Almost all antigens that are currently explored as targets for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or T cell receptor (TCR)-T cell therapy are also expressed by healthy cells and the risk of on-target off-tumor toxicity has remained a major concern. Recent studies suggest that this risk could be obviated by targeting instead combinations of two or more antigens, which are co-expressed by tumor but not normal cells and, as such, are tumor-specific. Moreover, the expression of a shared tumor antigen along with the lack of a second antigen that is expressed by normal tissues can also be exploited for precise recognition. Additional cues, antigenic or non-antigenic ones, which characterize the tumor microenvironment, could be harnessed to further increase precision. This review focuses on attempts to define the targetable signatures of tumors and assesses different strategies employing advanced synthetic biology for translating such information into safer modes of immunotherapy, implementing the principles of Boolean logic gates.",

Decades of research have improved our understanding of PDAC carcinogenesis, including characterizing germline predisposition, the cell of origin, precursor lesions, the sequence of genetic alterations, including simple and structural alterations, transcriptional changes and subtypes, tumour heterogeneity, metastatic progression and the tumour microenvironment. These fundamental advances inform contemporary translational efforts in primary prevention, screening and early detection, multidisciplinary management and survivorship, as prospective clinical trials begin to adopt molecular-based selection criteria to guide targeted therapies. Genomic and transcriptomic data on PDAC were also included in the international pan-cancer analysis of approximately 2,600 cancers, a milestone in cancer research that allows further insight through comparison with other tumour types. Thus, this is an ideal time to review our current knowledge of PDAC evolution and heterogeneity, gained from the study of preclinical models and patient biospecimens, and to propose a model of PDAC evolution that takes into consideration findings from varied sources, with a particular focus on the genomics of human PDAC.",

While young adult tumors generally show lower mutation burdens and comparable copy-number variation rates compared to later-onset cases, they are enriched for multiple driver mutations and copy-number alterations in subtype-specific contexts. Characterization of tumor immune microenvironments reveals pan-cancer patterns of elevated TGF-\u03b2 response/dendritic cells and lower IFN-\u03b3 response/macrophages relative to later-onset tumors, corresponding to age-related responses to immunotherapy in several cancer types. Finally, we identify prevalent clinically actionable events that disproportionally affect young adult or later-onset cases.

We observed frequent deletions (~38%) and significant down-regulation of MYH10 in primary HCC tissues. Deletion or decreased expression of MYH10 was a potential indicator of poor outcomes in HCC patients. Knockdown of MYH10\u00a0significantly promotes HCC cell migration and invasion in vitro, and overexpression of MYH10 exhibits opposite effects. Further, inhibition of MYH10\u00a0markedly potentiates HCC metastasis in vivo. We preliminarily elucidated the mechanism by which loss of MYH10 promotes HCC metastasis by facilitating EGFR pathway activation. In conclusion, our study suggests that MYH10, a candidate target gene for 17p13 deletion, acts as a tumour suppressor and may serve as a potential prognostic indicator for HCC patients.",

			"abstract": "Intra-tumor heterogeneity is a phenomenon in which mutation profiles differ from cell to cell within the same tumor and is observed in almost all tumors. Understanding intra-tumor heterogeneity is essential from the clinical perspective. Numerous methods have been developed to predict this phenomenon based on variant allele frequency. Among the methods, CloneSig models the variant allele frequency and mutation signatures simultaneously and provides an accurate clone decomposition. However, this method has limitations in terms of clone number selection and modeling. We propose SigTracer, a novel hierarchical Bayesian approach for analyzing intra-tumor heterogeneity based on mutation signatures to tackle these issues. We show that SigTracer predicts more reasonable clone decompositions than the existing methods against artificial data that mimic cancer genomes. We applied SigTracer to whole-genome sequences of blood cancer samples. The results were consistent with past findings that single base substitutions caused by a specific signature (previously reported as SBS9) related to the activation-induced cytidine deaminase intensively lie within immunoglobulin-coding regions for chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples. Furthermore, we showed that this signature mutates regions responsible for cell-cell adhesion. Accurate assignments of mutations to signatures by SigTracer can provide novel insights into signature origins and mutational processes.",

Genomic profiling of cell-free DNA from liquid biopsy using massively parallel sequencing is emerging as an attractive, non-invasive screening platform for sensitive detection of multiple types of cancer in a single assay. Genomic data from cell-free DNA can not only identify oncogenic mutation status, but also additional molecular signatures related to potential tissue of origin, the extent of clonal growth, and malignant disease states. Utilization of the full potential of the molecular signatures from cfDNA sequencing data can guide clinical management strategies for targeted follow-ups using imaging or molecular marker-based diagnostic platforms and treatment options.",

The diverse clinical responses and metastatic developments are attributed to extensive intrapatient genetic heterogeneity and tumor evolution acting on this neoplasm. In this work, we aimed to evaluate genomic alterations and tumor evolution in TNBC patients with aggressive disease. We sequenced the whole exome of 16 lesions from four patients who did not respond to therapy, and took several follow-up samples, including samples from tumors before and after treatment, as well as from the lymph nodes and skin metastases. We found substantial intrapatient genetic heterogeneity, with a variable tumor mutational composition. Early truncal events were ",

			"abstract": "Over the years, multiple biomarkers have been used to aid in disease screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and response to therapy. As of late, protein biomarkers are gaining strength in their role for early disease diagnosis and prognosis in part due to the advancements in identification and characterization of a distinct functional pool of proteins known as proteoforms. Proteoforms are defined as all of the different molecular forms of a protein derived from a single gene caused by genetic variations, alternative spliced RNA transcripts and post-translational modifications. Monitoring the structural changes of each proteoform of a particular protein is essential to elucidate the complex molecular mechanisms that guide the course of disease. Clinical proteomics therefore holds the potential to offer further insight into disease pathology, progression, and prevention. Nevertheless, more technologically advanced diagnostic methods are needed to improve the reliability and clinical applicability of proteomics in preventive medicine. In this manuscript, we review the use of immunoaffinity capillary electrophoresis (IACE) as an emerging powerful diagnostic tool to isolate, separate, detect and characterize proteoform biomarkers obtained from liquid biopsy. IACE is an affinity capture-separation technology capable of isolating, concentrating and analyzing a wide range of biomarkers present in biological fluids. Isolation and concentration of target analytes is accomplished through binding to one or more biorecognition affinity ligands immobilized to a solid support, while separation and analysis are achieved by high-resolution capillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled to one or more detectors. IACE has the potential to generate rapid results with significant accuracy, leading to reliability and reproducibility in diagnosing and monitoring disease. Additionally, IACE has the capability of monitoring the efficacy of therapeutic agents by quantifying companion and complementary protein biomarkers. With advancements in telemedicine and artificial intelligence, the implementation of proteoform biomarker detection and analysis may significantly improve our capacity to identify medical conditions early and intervene in ways that improve health outcomes for individuals and populations.",

The development of high-throughput sequencing-and more recently, of single-cell technologies-has shed light on the intratumoral diversity of leukemic cells. Taking AML as a model disease, we review the multiple sources of genetic, epigenetic, and functional heterogeneity of leukemic cells and discuss the definition of a leukemic clone extending its definition beyond genetics. After introducing the two dimensions contributing to clonal diversity, namely, richness (number of leukemic clones) and evenness (distribution of clone sizes), we discuss the mechanisms at the origin of clonal emergence (mutation rate, number of generations, and effective size of the leukemic population) and the causes of clonal dynamics. We discuss the possible role of neutral drift, but also of cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic influences on clonal fitness. After reviewing available data on the prognostic role of genetic and epigenetic diversity of leukemic cells on patients' outcome, we discuss how a better understanding of AML as an evolutionary process could lead to the design of novel therapeutic strategies in this disease.",

The mechanisms underlying these differences remain elusive, and understanding them can potentially identify novel pathways involved in ESCN development. We performed short-read sequencing to identify somatic variants on a cancer panel targeting 409 genes using DNA extracted from the superficial squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues and adjacent non-neoplastic epithelium (NE), and immunohistochemical staining of the protein encoded by the target gene. All male patients (n\u2009=\u2009117) were drinkers or smokers, whereas 45% of the female patients (n\u2009=\u200933) were not. Somatic variants were compared among three age-matched groups: 13 female ESCC patients with smoking and drinking habits (known-risk group, F-KR), 13 female ESCC patients without these habits (unknown-risk group, F-UR), and 27 males with ESCC and smoking and drinking habits (M-KR). In the NE, the frequencies of CDKN2A variants were significantly higher in F-UR than in F-KR and M-KR. In both ESCC and NE, p14ARF was significantly overexpressed in F-UR than in the other groups. In conclusion, CDKN2A might be important in ESCC development, independent of known risk factors.",

Here we present a pathway-centric approach, extracting somatic mutational profiles within and between tissues, largely orthogonal to cell of origin, mutational burden, or stage. Known predisposition variants are equally distributed among clusters, and largely independent of molecular subtype. Prognosis and risk of death vary jointly by cancer type and cluster. Analysis of metastatic tumors reveals that differences are largely cluster-specific and complementary, implicating convergent mechanisms that combine familiar driver genes with diverse low-frequency lesions in tumor-promoting pathways, ultimately producing distinct molecular phenotypes.

			"abstract": "The majority of cancers are driven by multiple genetic alterations, but how these changes collaborate during tumorigenesis remains largely unknown. To gain mechanistic insights into tumor-promoting genetic interactions among tumor suppressor genes (TSG), we conducted combinatorial CRISPR screening coupled with single-cell transcriptomic profiling in human mammary epithelial cells. As expected, different driver gene alterations in mammary epithelial cells influenced the repertoire of tumor suppressor alterations capable of inducing tumor formation. More surprisingly, TSG interaction networks were comprised of numerous cliques-sets of three or four genes such that each TSG within the clique showed oncogenic cooperation with all other genes in the clique. Genetic interaction profiling indicated that the predominant cooperating TSGs shared overlapping functions rather than distinct or complementary functions. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling of CRISPR double knockouts revealed that cooperating TSGs that synergized in promoting tumorigenesis and growth factor independence showed transcriptional epistasis, whereas noncooperating TSGs did not. These epistatic transcriptional changes, both buffering and synergistic, affected expression of oncogenic mediators and therapeutic targets, including CDK4, SRPK1, and DNMT1.

Oesophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and the pre-invasive tissue, Barrett's oesophagus (BE), provide an ideal example in which to observe and study this evolution. BE displays early genomic instability, specifically in copy number changes that may later be observed in EAC. Furthermore, these early changes result in patterns of progression (that is, 'born bad', gradual or catastrophic) that may help to describe the evolution of EAC. As only a small proportion of patients with BE will go on to develop cancer, a better understanding of these patterns and the resulting genomic changes should improve early detection in EAC and may provide clues for the evolution of cancer more broadly.",

To validate our hypothesis, we computed the mutation histories from the tandem repeat regions in blood-derived exomic DNA of 3874 TCGA patients with different cancer types and found a statistically significant signal with specificity ranging from 66% to 93% differentiating Glioblastoma patients from other cancer patients.

The other subtypes are characterized by specific amplifications and EGFR mutations (mezzo-forte) and whole-genome doubling (forte).

Recent work has shown that mutational signatures may also yield therapeutic and prognostic insights, including the identification of cell-intrinsic signatures as biomarkers of drug response and prognosis. For example, mutational signatures indicating homologous recombination deficiency are associated with poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor sensitivity, whereas APOBEC-associated signatures are associated with ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase (ATR) inhibitor sensitivity. Furthermore, therapy-induced mutational signatures implicated in cancer progression have also been uncovered, including the identification of thiopurine-induced TP53 mutations in leukemia.

Whole-genome doubling, chromosomal chromoplexy and chromothripsis represent examples of single catastrophic events which can drive tumour evolution. Second, neutral evolution can play a role in some tumours, indicating that selection is not always driving evolution. Third, increasing appreciation of the role of the ageing soma has led to recent generalised theories of age-dependent carcinogenesis. Here, we review these concepts and others, which collectively argue for a model of cancer evolution which extends beyond Darwin. We also highlight clinical opportunities which can be grasped through targeting cancer vulnerabilities arising from non-Darwinian patterns of evolution.",

Recently, a variety of new findings have been reported based on multi-omics analysis in combination with various clinical information. However, integrated analysis of multi-omics data is extremely labor intensive, making the development of new analysis technology indispensable. Artificial intelligence (AI), which has been under development in recent years, is quickly becoming an effective approach to reduce the labor involved in analyzing large amounts of complex data and to obtain valuable information that is often overlooked in manual analysis and experiments. The use of AI, such as machine learning approaches and deep learning systems, allows for the efficient analysis of massive omics data combined with accurate clinical information and can lead to comprehensive predictive models that will be desirable for further developing individual treatment strategies of immunotherapy and molecular target therapy. Here, we aim to review the potential of AI in the integrated analysis of omics data and clinical information with a special focus on recent advances in the discovery of new biomarkers and the future direction of personalized medicine in non-small lung cancer.",

Existing CCF estimation methods from bulk DNA sequencing data assume that every cell with an SNV contains the same number of copies of the SNV. This assumption is unrealistic in tumors with copy-number aberrations that alter SNV multiplicities. Furthermore, the CCF does not account for SNV losses due to copy-number aberrations, confounding downstream phylogenetic analyses. We introduce DeCiFer, an algorithm that overcomes these limitations by clustering SNVs using a novel statistic, the descendant cell fraction (DCF). The DCF quantifies both the prevalence of an SNV at the present time and its past evolutionary history using an evolutionary model that allows mutation losses. We show that DeCiFer yields more parsimonious reconstructions of tumor evolution than previously reported for 49 prostate cancer samples.",

However, a heterogeneous tumor transcriptome contributes an unknown level of variability to analyses of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that may contribute to phenotypes of interest, including treatment response. Although current clinical practice and the vast majority of research studies use a single sample from each patient, decreasing costs of sequencing technologies and computing power have made repeated-measures analyses increasingly economical. Repeatedly sampling the same tumor increases the statistical power of DEG analysis, which is indispensable toward downstream analysis and also increases one's understanding of within-tumor variance, which may affect conclusions. Here, we compared five different methods for analyzing gene expression profiles derived from repeated sampling of human prostate tumors in two separate cohorts of patients. We also benchmarked the sensitivity of generalized linear models to linear mixed models for identifying DEGs contributing to relevant prostate cancer pathways based on a ground-truth model.",

The secreted products of CAFs play important roles in regulating tumor cells and further impacting clinical prognosis. This study aims to reveal the relationship between CAF-secreted cytokines and breast cancer (BC) by constructing the risk signature. We performed three algorithms to reveal CAF-related cytokines in the TCGA BC dataset and identified five prognosis-related cytokines. Then we used single-cell RNA sequencing (ScRNA-Seq) datasets of BC to confirm the expression level of these five cytokines in CAFs. METABRIC and other independent datasets were utilized to validate the findings in further analyses. Based on the identified five-cytokine signature derived from CAFs, BC patients with high-risk score (RS) had shorter overall survival than low-RS cases. Further analysis suggested that the high-RS level correlated with cell proliferation and mast cell infiltration in BCs of the Basal-like subtype. The results also indicated that the level of RS could discriminate the high-risk BC cases harboring driver mutations (i.e., PI3KCA, CDH1, and TP53). Additionally, the status of five-cytokine signature was associated with the frequency and molecular timing of whole genome duplication (WGD) events. Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) analysis among BC samples indicated that the high-RS level was associated with the increase of tumor subclones. This work demonstrated that the prognostic signature based on CAF-secreted cytokines was associated with clinical outcome, tumor progression, and genetic alteration. Our findings may provide insights to develop novel strategies for early intervention and prognostic prediction of BC.",

			"abstract": "In recent years it has been shown that silent mutations, in and out of the coding region, can affect gene expression and may be related to tumorigenesis and cancer cell fitness. However, the predictive ability of these mutations for cancer type diagnosis and prognosis has not been evaluated yet. In the current study, based on the analysis of 9,915 cancer genomes and approximately three million mutations, we provide a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of the predictive power of various types of silent and non-silent mutations over cancer classification and prognosis. The results indicate that silent-mutation models outperform the equivalent null models in classifying all examined cancer types and in estimating the probability of survival 10 years after the initial diagnosis. Additionally, combining both non-silent and silent mutations achieved the best classification results for 68% of the cancer types and the best survival estimation results for up to nine years after the diagnosis. Thus, silent mutations hold considerable predictive power over both cancer classification and prognosis, most likely due to their effect on gene expression. It is highly advised that silent mutations are integrated in cancer research in order to unravel the full genomic landscape of cancer and its ramifications on cancer fitness.",

However, their contributions to the mutation burden and clonal expansions of healthy somatic tissues are not clear.

Cells of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) secondary to treatment with platinum-based drugs show the mutational footprint of these drugs, indicating that non-malignant blood cells receive chemotherapy mutations. No trace of the\u00a05-fluorouracil (5FU) mutational signature is found in AMLs secondary to exposure to 5FU, suggesting that cells establishing the\u00a0leukemia could be quiescent during treatment. Using the platinum-based mutational signature as a barcode, we determine that the clonal expansion originating the secondary AMLs begins after the start of the cytotoxic treatment. Its absence in clonal hematopoiesis cases is consistent with the start of the clonal expansion predating the exposure to platinum-based drugs.",

Within the biopsy interval (median, 6.4\u2009months), patients received one or multiple lines of (mostly) standard-of-care (SOC) treatments, with all major treatment modalities being broadly represented. SOC biomarkers and biomarkers for clinical trial enrollment could be identified in 23% and 72% of biopsies, respectively. For SOC genomic biomarkers, we observed full concordance between the first and the second biopsy in 99% of pairs. Of the 219 biomarkers for clinical trial enrollment that were identified in the first biopsies, we recovered 94% in the follow-up biopsies. Furthermore, a second WGS analysis did not identify additional biomarkers for clinical trial enrollment in 91% of patients. More-frequent genomic evolution was observed when considering specific genes targeted by small-molecule inhibitors or hormonal therapies (21% and 22% of cases, respectively). Together, our data demonstrate that there is limited evolution of the actionable genome of treated metastases. A single WGS analysis of a metastatic biopsy is generally sufficient to identify SOC genomic biomarkers and to identify investigational treatment opportunities.",

			"abstract": "Cancer progression has been attributed to somatic changes in single-nucleotide variants, copy-number aberrations, loss of heterozygosity, chromosomal instability, epistatic interactions, and the tumor microenvironment. It is not entirely clear which of these changes are essential and which are ancillary to cancer. The dynamic nature of cancer evolution in a patient can be illuminated using several concepts and tools from classical evolutionary biology. Neutral mutation rates in cancer cells are calculable from genomic data such as synonymous mutations, and selective pressures are calculable from rates of fixation occurring beyond the expectation by neutral mutation and drift. However, these cancer effect sizes of mutations are complicated by epistatic interactions that can determine the likely sequence of gene mutations. In turn, longitudinal phylogenetic analyses of somatic cancer progression offer an opportunity to identify key moments in cancer evolution, relating the timing of driver mutations to corresponding landmarks in the clinical timeline. These analyses reveal temporal aspects of genetic and phenotypic change during tumorigenesis and across clinical timescales. Using a related framework, clonal deconvolution, physical locations of clones, and their phylogenetic relations can be used to infer tumor migration histories. Additionally, genetic interactions with the tumor microenvironment can be analyzed with longstanding approaches applied to organismal genotype-by-environment interactions. Fitness landscapes for cancer evolution relating to genotype, phenotype, and environment could enable more accurate, personalized therapeutic strategies. An understanding of the trajectories underlying the evolution of neoplasms, primary, and metastatic tumors promises fundamental advances toward accurate and personalized predictions of therapeutic response.",

Current limitations in early detection impede lung cancer diagnosis when the disease is still localized and thus more curable by surgery or multimodality treatment.

Here, we reviewed recent advances in liquid biopsy for early diagnosis of lung cancer. We summarized DNA- or RNA-based biomarkers, proteins, autoantibodies circulating in the blood, as well as circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and compared the most promising studies in terms of biomarkers prediction performance. While we observed an overall good performance for the proposed biomarkers, we noticed some critical aspects which may complicate the successful translation of these biomarkers into the clinical setting. We, therefore, proposed a roadmap for successful development of lung cancer biomarkers during the discovery, prioritization, and clinical validation phase.

However, it is not clear to what degree evolutionary forecasts can be extended to related species in non-identical environments, which would allow testing of general predictive models and fundamental biological assumptions. To develop an extended model system for evolutionary forecasting, we used previous data and models of the genotype-to-phenotype map from the wrinkly spreader system in Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 to make predictions of evolutionary outcomes on different biological levels for Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5. In addition to sequence divergence (78% amino acid and 81% nucleotide identity) for the genes targeted by mutations, these species also differ in the inability of Pf-5 to make cellulose, which is the main structural basis for the adaptive phenotype in SBW25. The experimental conditions were changed compared to the SBW25 system to test if forecasts were extendable to a non-identical environment. Forty-three mutants with increased ability to colonize the air-liquid interface were isolated, and the majority had reduced motility and was partly dependent on the Pel exopolysaccharide as a structural component. Most (38/43) mutations are expected to disrupt negative regulation of the same three diguanylate cyclases as in SBW25, with a smaller number of mutations in promoter regions, including an uncharacterized polysaccharide synthase operon. A mathematical model developed for SBW25 predicted the order of the three main pathways and the genes targeted by mutations, but differences in fitness between mutants and mutational biases also appear to influence outcomes. Mutated regions in proteins could be predicted in most cases (16/22), but parallelism at the nucleotide level was low and mutational hot spot sites were not conserved. This study demonstrates the potential of short-term evolutionary forecasting in experimental populations and provides testable predictions for evolutionary outcomes in other Pseudomonas species.",

Comparison of copy number alteration patterns between oral leukoplakia with hyperplasia (HOL, n=22) and dysplasia (DOL, n=21) showed that oral leukoplakia with dysplasia had a higher copy number alteration rate (86%) than oral leukoplakia with hyperplasia (46%).

We also examined a retrospective cohort of 477 patients with oral leukoplakia with hyperplasia with detailed follow-up information.

			"abstract": "Polyguanine tracts (PolyGs) are short guanine homopolymer repeats that are prone to accumulating mutations when cells divide. This feature makes them especially suitable for cell lineage tracing, which has been exploited to detect and characterize precancerous and cancerous somatic evolution. PolyG genotyping, however, is challenging because of the inherent biochemical difficulties in amplifying and sequencing repetitive regions. To overcome this limitation, we developed PolyG-DS, a next-generation sequencing (NGS) method that combines the error-correction capabilities of duplex sequencing (DS) with enrichment of PolyG loci using CRISPR-Cas9-targeted genomic fragmentation. PolyG-DS markedly reduces technical artifacts by comparing the sequences derived from the complementary strands of each original DNA molecule. We demonstrate that PolyG-DS genotyping is accurate, reproducible, and highly sensitive, enabling the detection of low-frequency alleles (<0.01) in spike-in samples using a panel of only 19 PolyG markers. PolyG-DS replicated prior results based on PolyG fragment length analysis by capillary electrophoresis, and exhibited higher sensitivity for identifying clonal expansions in the nondysplastic colon of patients with ulcerative colitis. We illustrate the utility of this method for resolving the phylogenetic relationship among precancerous lesions in ulcerative colitis and for tracing the metastatic dissemination of ovarian cancer. PolyG-DS enables the study of tumor evolution without prior knowledge of tumor driver mutations and provides a tool to perform cost-effective and easily scalable ultra-accurate NGS-based PolyG genotyping for multiple applications in biology, genetics, and cancer research.",

			"abstract": "Mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) are frequently observed in cancer cells and are regarded as one of the common features of cancers. Strikingly, accumulating studies demonstrated that mCAs are also prevalent in elderly individuals without cancer, implying mCA could be a feature of aging and not necessarily a cancerous state. However, the genetic basis of mCA has been mostly unknown. Recent studies of autosomal mCA based on biobank-scale datasets, including UK Biobank and Biobank Japan, provided a glimpse into the underlying genetic mechanism. In this concise review, we briefly introduced mCA, its link with cancer and aging, and the emerging genetic mechanisms of this phenomenon. We highlighted the following aspects: (1) the interplay between somatic and inherited germline mutations in generating mosaicism; (2) monogenic and polygenic architectures of mCA; and (3) population-specific profiles of mCA. We provided a future perspective emphasizing the need to understand the connection between mCA and other characteristics of aging, in particular, the epigenetic and immunologic features.",

Here we annotate genomic variants in 2,658 cancers from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) cohort with links to similar sites across the human genome. We train a machine learning model to use signals distributed over multiple genomic sites to call somatic events in non-unique regions and validate the data against linked-read sequencing in an independent dataset. Using this approach, we uncover previously hidden mutations in ~1,700 coding sequences and in thousands of regulatory elements, including in known cancer genes, immunoglobulins and highly mutated gene families. Mutations in non-unique regions are consistent with mutations in unique regions in terms of mutation burden and substitution profiles. The analysis provides a systematic summary of the mutation events in non-unique regions at a genome-wide scale across multiple human cancers.",

			"abstract": "Cancer genomes have been explored from the early 2000s through massive exome sequencing efforts, leading to the publication of The Cancer Genome Atlas in 2013. Sequencing techniques have been developed alongside this project and have allowed scientists to bypass the limitation of costs for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of single specimens by developing more accurate and extensive cancer sequencing projects, such as deep sequencing of whole genomes and transcriptomic analysis. The Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes recently published WGS data from more than 2600 human cancers together with almost 1200 related transcriptomes. The application of WGS on a large database allowed, for the first time in history, a global analysis of features such as molecular signatures, large structural variations and noncoding regions of the genome, as well as the evaluation of RNA alterations in the absence of underlying DNA mutations. The vast amount of data generated still needs to be thoroughly deciphered, and the advent of machine-learning approaches will be the next step towards the generation of personalized approaches for cancer medicine. The present manuscript wants to give a broad perspective on some of the biological evidence derived from the largest sequencing attempts on human cancers so far, discussing advantages and limitations of this approach and its power in the era of machine learning.",

			"abstract": "The somatic landscape of the cancer genome results from different mutational processes represented by distinct \"mutational signatures.\" Although several mutagenic mechanisms are known to cause specific mutational signatures in cell lines, the variation of somatic mutational activities in patients, which is mostly attributed to somatic selection, is still poorly explained. Here, we introduce a quantitative trait, mutational propensity (MP), and describe an integrated method to infer genetic determinants of variations in the mutational processes in 3,566 cancers with specific underlying mechanisms. As a result, we report 2,314 candidate determinants with both significant germline and somatic effects on somatic selection of mutational processes, of which, 485 act via cancer gene expression and 1,427 act through the tumor-immune microenvironment. These data demonstrate that the genetic determinants of MPs provide complementary information to known cancer driver genes, clonal evolution, and clinical biomarkers. SIGNIFICANCE: The genetic determinants of the somatic mutational processes in cancer elucidate the biology underlying somatic selection and evolution of cancers and demonstrate complementary predictive power across cancer types.",

In an unprecedented international effort, the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) sequenced the tumors of over two thousand five hundred patients across 38 different cancer types, as well as the\u00a0corresponding healthy tissue, with the aim of identifying genome-wide mutations exclusively found in cancer and uncovering new genetic changes that drive tumor formation. What set this project apart from earlier efforts is the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) that enabled to explore alterations beyond the\u00a0coding DNA, into cancer's non-coding genome. WGS of the entire cohort allowed to tease apart driving mutations that initiate and support carcinogenesis from passenger mutations that do not play an overt role in the disease. At least one causative mutation was found in 95% of all cancers, with many tumors showing an average of 5 driver mutations. The\u00a0PCAWG Project also assessed the transcriptional output altered in cancer and rebuilt the evolutionary history of each tumor showing that initial driver mutations can\u00a0occur years if not decades prior to a diagnosis. Here, I provide a concise review of the\u00a0Pan-Cancer Project papers published on February 2020, along with key computational tools and the\u00a0digital framework generated as part of the project. This represents an historic effort by hundreds of international collaborators, which provides a comprehensive understanding of cancer genetics, with publicly available data and resources representing a treasure trove of information to advance cancer research for years to come.",

The high clinical relevance has made p53 a model transcription factor for delineating general mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. p53 forms tetramers that bind DNA in a highly cooperative manner. The DNA binding cooperativity of p53 has been studied by structural and molecular biologists as well as clinical oncologists. These experiments have revealed the structural basis for cooperative DNA binding and its impact on sequence specificity and target gene spectrum. Cooperativity was found to be critical for the control of p53-mediated cell fate decisions and tumor suppression. Importantly, an estimated number of 34,000 cancer patients per year world-wide have mutations of the amino acids mediating cooperativity, and knock-in mouse models have confirmed such mutations to be tumorigenic. While p53 cancer mutations are classically subdivided into \"contact\" and \"structural\" mutations, \"cooperativity\" mutations form a mechanistically distinct third class that affect the quaternary structure but leave DNA contacting residues and the three-dimensional folding of the DNA-binding domain intact. In this review we discuss the concept of DNA binding cooperativity and highlight the unique nature of cooperativity mutations and their clinical implications for cancer therapy.",

To unlock liquid biopsy analysis for pediatric tumors with few genetic aberrations, we introduce an integrated genetic/epigenetic analysis method and demonstrate its utility on 241 deep whole-genome sequencing profiles of 95 patients with Ewing sarcoma and 31 patients with other pediatric sarcomas. Our method achieves sensitive detection and classification of circulating tumor DNA in peripheral blood independent of any genetic alterations. Moreover, we benchmark different metrics for cell-free DNA fragmentation analysis, and we introduce the LIQUORICE algorithm for detecting circulating tumor DNA based on cancer-specific chromatin signatures. Finally, we combine several fragmentation-based metrics into an integrated machine learning classifier for liquid biopsy analysis that exploits widespread epigenetic deregulation and\u00a0is tailored to cancers with low mutation rates. Clinical associations highlight the potential value of cfDNA fragmentation patterns as prognostic biomarkers in Ewing sarcoma. In summary, our study provides a comprehensive analysis of circulating tumor DNA beyond recurrent genetic aberrations, and it renders the benefits of liquid biopsy more readily accessible for childhood cancers.",

Here, we investigate these questions in exome sequencing data from 42 baseline and progression biopsies from cetuximab-treated CRCs. Mutation loads did not increase from baseline to progression, and evidence for a contribution of adaptive mutagenesis was limited. However, the chemotherapy-induced mutational signature SBS17b was the main contributor of specific KRAS/NRAS and EGFR driver mutations that are enriched at acquired resistance. Detectable SBS17b activity before treatment predicted shorter progression-free survival and the evolution of these specific mutations during subsequent cetuximab treatment. This result suggests that chemotherapy mutagenesis can accelerate resistance evolution. Mutational signatures may be a new class of cancer evolution predictor.",

			"abstract": "Like many other types of cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC) develops through multiple pathways of carcinogenesis. This is also true for colorectal carcinogenesis in Lynch syndrome (LS), the most common inherited CRC syndrome. However, a comprehensive understanding of the distribution of these pathways of carcinogenesis, which allows for tailored clinical treatment and even prevention, is still lacking. We suggest a linear dynamical system modeling the evolution of different pathways of colorectal carcinogenesis based on the involved driver mutations. The model consists of different components accounting for independent and dependent mutational processes. We define the driver gene mutation graphs and combine them using the Cartesian graph product. This leads to matrix components built by the Kronecker sum and product of the adjacency matrices of the gene mutation graphs enabling a thorough mathematical analysis and medical interpretation. Using the Kronecker structure, we developed a mathematical model which we applied exemplarily to the three pathways of colorectal carcinogenesis in LS. Beside a pathogenic germline variant in one of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, driver mutations in APC, CTNNB1, KRAS and TP53 are considered. We exemplarily incorporate mutational dependencies, such as increased point mutation rates after MMR deficiency, and based on recent experimental data, biallelic somatic CTNNB1 mutations as common drivers of LS-associated CRCs. With the model and parameter choice, we obtained simulation results that are in concordance with clinical observations. These include the evolution of MMR-deficient crypts as early precursors in LS carcinogenesis and the influence of variants in MMR genes thereon. The proportions of MMR-deficient and MMR-proficient APC-inactivated crypts as first measure for the distribution among the pathways in LS-associated colorectal carcinogenesis are compatible with clinical observations. The approach provides a modular framework for modeling multiple pathways of carcinogenesis yielding promising results in concordance with clinical observations in LS CRCs.",

Here we detect, categorize, and characterize site-specific hotspots using 2279 whole cancer genomes from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes project and provide a resource of annotated hotspots genome-wide. We investigate the excess of hotspots in both protein-coding and gene regulatory regions and develop measures of positive selection and functional impact for individual hotspots. Using cancer allele fractions, expression aberrations, mutational signatures, and a variety of genomic features, such as potential gain or loss of transcription factor binding sites, we annotate and prioritize all highly mutated hotspots. Genome-wide we find more high-frequency SNV and indel hotspots than expected given mutational background models. Protein-coding regions are generally enriched for SNV hotspots compared to other regions. Gene regulatory hotspots show enrichment of potential same-patient second-hit missense mutations, consistent with enrichment of hotspot driver mutations compared to singletons. For protein-coding regions, splice-sites, promoters, and enhancers, we see an excess of hotspots associated with cancer genes. Interestingly, missense hotspot mutations in tumor suppressors are associated with elevated expression, suggesting localized amino-acid changes with functional impact. For individual non-coding hotspots, only a small number show clear signs of positive selection, including known sites in the TERT promoter and the 5' UTR of TP53. Most of the new candidates have few mutations and limited driver evidence. However, a hotspot in an enhancer of the oncogene POU2AF1, which may create a transcription factor binding site, presents multiple lines of driver-consistent evidence.",

In this Review, we describe lung cancer diagnosis and monitoring strategies using ctDNA detection technologies and compile recent evidence regarding lung cancer-related mutation detection in liquid biopsy. We focus not only on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) alterations, but also on significant co-mutations that shed more light on novel ctDNA-based liquid biopsy applications.

Genetic studies indicate that the OS genome is extremely complex, presenting signs of macro-evolution, and linear and branched patterns of clonal development. However, those studies were based on the phylogenetic reconstruction of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, which present important limitations. Thus, testing clonal evolution in experimental models could be useful for validating this hypothesis. In the present study, lentiviral LeGO-vectors were employed to generate colorimetric red, green, blue (RGB)-marking in murine, canine, and human OS. With this strategy, we studied tumor heterogeneity and the clonal dynamics occurring in vivo in immunodeficient NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid-Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice. Based on colorimetric label, tumor clonal composition was analyzed by confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and different types of supervised and unsupervised clonal analyses. With this approach, we observed a consistent reduction in the clonal composition of RGB-marked tumors and identified evident clonal selection at the first passage in immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that OS could follow a neutral model of growth, where the disease is defined by the coexistence of different tumor sub-clones. Our study demonstrates the importance of rigorous testing of the selective forces in commonly used experimental models.",

			"abstract": "Genome instability and loss of protein homeostasis are hallmark events of age-related diseases that include neurodegeneration. Several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are characterized by protein aggregation, while an impaired DNA damage response (DDR) as in many genetic DNA repair disorders leads to pronounced neuropathological features. It remains unclear to what degree these cellular events interconnect with each other in the development of neurological diseases. This review highlights how the loss of protein homeostasis and genome instability influence one other. We will discuss studies that illustrate this connection. DNA damage contributes to many neurodegenerative diseases, as shown by an increased level of DNA damage in patients, possibly due to the effects of protein aggregates on chromatin, the sequestration of DNA repair proteins and novel putative DNA repair functions. Conversely, genome stability is also important for protein homeostasis. For example, gene copy number variations and the loss of key DDR components can lead to marked proteotoxic stress. An improved understanding of how protein homeostasis and genome stability are mechanistically connected is needed and promises to lead to the development of novel therapeutic interventions.",

If improperly repaired, DSBs can threaten genome integrity and contribute to premature ageing, neurodegenerative disorders and carcinogenesis. Through decades of work on genome stability, it has become evident that certain regions of the genome are inherently more prone to breakage than others, known as genome instability hotspots. Recent advancements in sequencing-based technologies now enable the profiling of genome-wide distributions of DSBs, also known as breakomes, to systematically map these instability hotspots. Here, we review the application of these technologies and their implications for our current understanding of the genomic regions most likely to drive genome instability. These breakomes ultimately highlight both new and established breakage hotspots including actively transcribed regions, loop boundaries and early-replicating regions of the genome. Further, these breakomes challenge the paradigm that DNA breakage primarily occurs in hard-to-replicate regions. With these advancements, we begin to gain insights into the biological mechanisms both invoking and protecting against genome instability.",

Adoptive T-cell therapy, involving the autologous or allogeneic transplant of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes or genetically modified T cells expressing novel T-cell receptors or chimeric antigen receptors, has shown promise in the treatment of cancer patients, leading to durable responses and, in some cases, cure. Technological advances in genomics, computational biology, immunology and cell manufacturing have brought the aspiration of individualised therapies for cancer patients closer to reality. This new era of cell-based individualised therapeutics challenges the traditional standards of therapeutic interventions and provides opportunities for a paradigm shift in our approach to cancer therapy. Invited speakers at a 2020 symposium discussed three areas-cancer genomics, cancer immunology and cell-therapy manufacturing-that are essential to the effective translation of T-cell therapies in the treatment of solid malignancies. Key advances have been made in understanding genetic intratumour heterogeneity, and strategies to accurately identify neoantigens, overcome T-cell exhaustion and circumvent tumour immunosuppression after cell-therapy infusion are being developed. Advances are being made in cell-manufacturing approaches that have the potential to establish cell-therapies as credible therapeutic options.

CENP-A, the centromeric histone H3 variant, is an epigenetic mark that directly perturbs genetic stability and chromatin when overexpressed. Although CENP-A overexpression is a common feature of many cancers, how this impacts cell fate and response to therapy remains unclear. Here, we established a tunable system of inducible and reversible CENP-A overexpression combined with a switch in p53 status in human cell lines. Through clonogenic survival assays, single-cell RNA-sequencing and cell trajectory analysis, we uncover the tumour suppressor p53 as a key determinant of how CENP-A impacts cell state, cell identity and therapeutic response. If p53 is functional, CENP-A overexpression promotes senescence and radiosensitivity. Surprisingly, when we inactivate p53, CENP-A overexpression instead promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition, an essential process in mammalian development but also a precursor for tumour cell invasion and metastasis. Thus, we uncover an unanticipated function of CENP-A overexpression to promote cell fate reprogramming, with important implications for development and tumour evolution.",

We interrogate the whole genome sequence (WGS) profile of 18 MGUS and compare them with those from 14 SMMs and 80 MMs. We show that cases with a non-progressing, clinically stable myeloma precursor condition (n\u2009=\u200915) are characterized by later initiation in the patient's life and by the absence of myeloma defining genomic events including: chromothripsis, templated insertions, mutations in driver genes, aneuploidy, and canonical APOBEC mutational activity. This data provides evidence that WGS can be used to recognize two biologically and clinically distinct myeloma precursor entities that are either progressive or stable.",

MPN-BP patients have a particularly dismal prognosis with a medium overall survival of 5.8 months with currently available therapies. Large-scale sequencing studies have unraveled the mutational landscape of the chronic MPNs and MPN-BP, demonstrating importance of clonal heterogeneity and the role of somatic mutations in disease progression and their use to determine patient outcomes. JAK inhibitors represent the standard of care for intermediate/high-risk MF patients and have been shown to improve clinical symptoms. However, this therapeutic approach leads to a modest reduction in the variant allele frequency of the known MPN driver mutations in most patients and does not substantially delay or prevent the evolution to MPN-BP. In this article, we will review molecular mechanisms driving the progression from chronic MPNs to a BP, the impact of genetic changes on MPN-BP evolution, and the role of clonal evolution in response to JAK inhibitor therapy and disease progression. We will also discuss our ongoing functional studies of cells responsible for the development of MPN-BP.",

			"abstract": "Most solid tumors are aneuploid, and p53 has been implicated as the guardian of the euploid genome. Previous experiments using human cell lines showed that aneuploidy induction leads to p53 accumulation and p21-mediated G1 cell cycle arrest. We find that adherent 2-dimensional (2D) cultures of human immortalized or cancer cell lines activate p53 upon aneuploidy induction, whereas suspension cultures of a human lymphoid cell line undergo a p53-independent cell cycle arrest. Surprisingly, 3D human and mouse organotypic cultures from neural, intestinal, or mammary epithelial tissues do not activate p53 or arrest in G1 following aneuploidy induction. p53-deficient colon organoids have increased aneuploidy and frequent lagging chromosomes and multipolar spindles during mitosis. These data suggest that p53 may not act as a universal surveillance factor restricting the proliferation of aneuploid cells but instead helps directly or indirectly ensure faithful chromosome transmission likely by preventing polyploidization and influencing spindle mechanics.",

			"abstract": "Cancer is a clonal disease, i.e., all tumor cells within a malignant lesion trace their lineage back to a precursor somatic cell that acquired oncogenic mutations during development and aging. And yet, those tumor cells tend to have genetic and nongenetic variations among themselves-which is denoted as intratumor heterogeneity. Although some of these variations are inconsequential, others tend to contribute to cell state transition and phenotypic heterogeneity, providing a substrate for somatic evolution. Tumor cell phenotypes can dynamically change under the influence of genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications, and microenvironmental contexts. Although epigenetic and microenvironmental changes are adaptive, genetic mutations are usually considered permanent. Emerging reports suggest that certain classes of genetic alterations show extensive reversibility in tumors in clinically relevant timescales, contributing as major drivers of dynamic intratumor heterogeneity and phenotypic plasticity. Dynamic heterogeneity and phenotypic plasticity can confer resistance to treatment, promote metastasis, and enhance evolvability in cancer. Here, we first highlight recent efforts to characterize intratumor heterogeneity at genetic, epigenetic, and microenvironmental levels. We then discuss phenotypic plasticity and cell state transition by tumor cells, under the influence of genetic and nongenetic determinants and their clinical significance in classification of tumors and therapeutic decision-making.",

			"abstract": "Polyploidy is present in many cancer types and is increasingly recognized as an important factor in promoting chromosomal instability, genome evolution, and heterogeneity in cancer cells. However, the mechanisms that trigger polyploidy in cancer cells are largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the origin of polyploidy in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a highly heterogenous cancer, using a combination of genomics and cell biology approaches in EAC cell lines, organoids, and tumors. We found the EAC cells and organoids present specific mitotic defects consistent with problems in the attachment of chromosomes to the microtubules of the mitotic spindle. Time-lapse analyses confirmed that EAC cells have problems in congressing and aligning their chromosomes, which can ultimately culminate in mitotic slippage and polyploidy. Furthermore, whole-genome sequencing, RNA-seq, and quantitative immunofluorescence analyses revealed alterations in the copy number, expression, and cellular distribution of several proteins known to be involved in the mechanics and regulation of chromosome dynamics during mitosis. Together, these results provide evidence that an imbalance in the amount of proteins implicated in the attachment of chromosomes to spindle microtubules is the molecular mechanism underlying mitotic slippage in EAC. Our findings that the likely origin of polyploidy in EAC is mitotic failure caused by problems in chromosomal attachments not only improves our understanding of cancer evolution and diversification, but may also aid in the classification and treatment of EAC and possibly other highly heterogeneous cancers.",

Whether there existed other epigenetic vulnerabilities that could serve as therapeutic targets remained unclear and promising. Here, we combined the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats functional screening results and multiple RCC datasets to identify JMJD6 as the potent target in RCC. JMJD6 expression correlated with poor survival outcomes of RCC patients and promoted RCC progression in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, aberrant p300 led to high JMJD6 expression, which activated a series of oncogenic crosstalk. Particularly, high-throughput sequencing data revealed that JMJD6 could assemble super-enhancers to drive a list of identity\u00a0genes in kidney cancer, including VEGFA, \u03b2-catenin, and SRC. Moreover, this JMJD6-mediated oncogenic effect could be suppressed by a novel JMJD6 inhibitor (SKLB325), which was further demonstrated in RCC cells, patient-derived organoid models, and in vivo. Given the probable overlapped crosstalk between JMJD6 signature and tyrosine kinase inhibitors downstream targets, targeting JMJD6 sensitized RCC to sunitinib and was synergistic when they were combined together. Collectively, this study indicated that targeting JMJD6 was an effective approach to treat RCC patients.",

Herein, we present data that describe the ability of oncogenic PIK3CA mutant cells to induce the proliferation of quiescent HER2 mutant cells through a cell contact-mediated mechanism. Interestingly, the HER2 cells proliferated to become the major subclone over PIK3CA counterparts both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, this phenotype was observed in both hormone receptor-positive and -negative cell lines, and was dependent on the expression of fibronectin from mutant PIK3CA cells. Analysis of human tumors demonstrated similar HER2:PIK3CA clonal dynamics and fibronectin expression.

Polyploid hepatocytes proliferate and dynamically reduce their ploidy during liver regeneration. This raises the question whether proliferating polyploids are prone to cancer via chromosome missegregation during mitosis and/or ploidy reduction. Conversely polyploids could be resistant to tumor development due to their redundant genomes. Therefore, the tumor-initiation risk of physiologic polyploidy and ploidy reduction is still unclear. Using in vivo lineage tracing we here show that polyploid hepatocytes readily form liver tumors via frequent ploidy reduction. Polyploid hepatocytes give rise to regenerative nodules with chromosome aberrations, which are enhanced by ploidy reduction. Although polyploidy should theoretically prevent tumor suppressor loss, the high frequency of ploidy reduction negates this protection. Importantly, polyploid hepatocytes that undergo multiple rounds of cell division become predominantly mononucleated and are resistant to ploidy reduction. Our results suggest that ploidy reduction is an early step in the initiation of carcinogenesis from polyploid hepatocytes.",

			"abstract": "Tumors contain multiple subpopulations of genetically distinct cancer cells. Reconstructing their evolutionary history can improve our understanding of how cancers develop and respond to treatment. Subclonal reconstruction methods cluster mutations into groups that co-occur within the same subpopulations, estimate the frequency of cells belonging to each subpopulation, and infer the ancestral relationships among the subpopulations by constructing a clone tree. However, often multiple clone trees are consistent with the data and current methods do not efficiently capture this uncertainty; nor can these methods scale to clone trees with a large number of subclonal populations. Here, we formalize the notion of a partially-defined clone tree (partial clone tree for short) that defines a subset of the pairwise ancestral relationships in a clone tree, thereby implicitly representing the set of all clone trees that have these defined pairwise relationships. Also, we introduce a special partial clone tree, the Maximally-Constrained Ancestral Reconstruction (MAR), which summarizes all clone trees fitting the input data equally well. Finally, we extend commonly used clone tree validity conditions to apply to partial clone trees and describe SubMARine, a polynomial-time algorithm producing the subMAR, which approximates the MAR and guarantees that its defined relationships are a subset of those present in the MAR. We also extend SubMARine to work with subclonal copy number aberrations and define equivalence constraints for this purpose. Further, we extend SubMARine to permit noise in the estimates of the subclonal frequencies while retaining its validity conditions and guarantees. In contrast to other clone tree reconstruction methods, SubMARine runs in time and space that scale polynomially in the number of subclones. We show through extensive noise-free simulation, a large lung cancer dataset and a prostate cancer dataset that the subMAR equals the MAR in all cases where only a single clone tree exists and that it is a perfect match to the MAR in most of the other cases. Notably, SubMARine runs in less than 70 seconds on a single thread with less than one Gb of memory on all datasets presented in this paper, including ones with 50 nodes in a clone tree. On the real-world data, SubMARine almost perfectly recovers the previously reported trees and identifies minor errors made in the expert-driven reconstructions of those trees. The freely-available open-source code implementing SubMARine can be downloaded at https://github.com/morrislab/submarine.",

			"abstract": "Stably acquired mutations in hematopoietic cells represent substrates of selection that may lead to clonal hematopoiesis (CH), a common state in cancer patients that is associated with a heightened risk of leukemia development. Owing to technical and sample size limitations, most CH studies have characterized gene mutations or mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) individually. Here we leverage peripheral blood sequencing data from 32,442 cancer patients to jointly characterize gene mutations (n\u2009=\u200914,789) and mCAs (n\u2009=\u2009383) in CH. Recurrent composite genotypes resembling known genetic interactions in leukemia genomes underlie 23% of all detected autosomal alterations, indicating that these selection mechanisms are operative early in clonal evolution. CH with composite genotypes defines a patient group at high risk of leukemia progression (3-year cumulative incidence 14.6%, CI: 7-22%). Multivariable analysis identifies mCA as an independent risk factor for leukemia development (HR\u2009=\u200914, 95% CI: 6-33, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Our results suggest that mCA should be considered in conjunction with gene mutations in the surveillance of patients at risk of hematologic neoplasms.",

New evidence emerging from both basic and clinical research has illuminated a complicated relationship: despite its frequency in human tumours, aneuploidy is not a universal driver of cancer development and instead can exert substantial tumour-suppressive effects. The specific consequences of aneuploidy are highly context dependent and are influenced by a cell's genetic and environmental milieu. In this Review, we discuss the diverse facets of cancer biology that are shaped by aneuploidy, including metastasis, drug resistance and immune recognition, and we highlight aneuploidy's distinct roles as both a tumour promoter and an anticancer vulnerability.",

Most approaches focused on genes positively selected for mutations that drive carcinogenesis and neglected the role of negative selection. Some studies have actually concluded that negative selection has no role in cancer evolution. We have re-examined the role of negative selection in tumor evolution through the analysis of the patterns of somatic mutations affecting the coding sequences of human genes. Our analyses have confirmed that tumor suppressor genes are positively selected for inactivating mutations, oncogenes, however, were found to display signals of both negative selection for inactivating mutations and positive selection for activating mutations. Significantly, we have identified numerous human genes that show signs of strong negative selection during tumor evolution, suggesting that their functional integrity is essential for the growth and survival of tumor cells.",

Here, we review how advances in our understanding of the genetic architectures of diseases, recent human evolution and deep evolutionary history can help explain how and why humans in modern environments become ill. Human populations exhibit differences in the prevalence of many common and rare genetic diseases. These differences are largely the result of the diverse environmental, cultural, demographic and genetic histories of modern human populations. Synthesizing our growing knowledge of evolutionary history with genetic medicine, while accounting for environmental and social factors, will help to achieve the promise of personalized genomics and realize the potential hidden in an individual's DNA sequence to guide clinical decisions. In short, precision medicine is fundamentally evolutionary medicine, and integration of evolutionary perspectives into the clinic will support the realization of its full potential.",

Most of these profiles are associated with recurrent non-overlapping rearrangements or hotspot point mutations that are analogous to the established subtypes, such as DUX4 rearrangements, MEF2D rearrangements, ZNF384/ZNF362 rearrangements, NUTM1 rearrangements, BCL2/MYC and/or BCL6 rearrangements, ETV6-RUNX1-like gene expression, PAX5alt (diverse PAX5 alterations, including rearrangements, intragenic amplifications, or mutations), and hotspot mutations PAX5 (p.Pro80Arg) with biallelic PAX5 alterations, IKZF1 (p.Asn159Tyr), and ZEB2 (p.His1038Arg). These molecular subtypes could be classified by gene expression patterns with RNA-seq technology. Refined molecular classification greatly improved the treatment strategy. Multiagent therapy regimens, including target inhibitors (e.g., imatinib), immunomodulators, monoclonal antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, are transforming the clinical practice from chemotherapy drugs to personalized medicine in the field of risk-directed disease management.

Primary prostate cancers are often multifocal, having topographically and morphologically distinct tumour foci. Sequencing studies have revealed that individual tumour foci can arise as clonally distinct lesions with no shared driver gene alterations. This finding demonstrates that multiple genomically and phenotypically distinct primary prostate cancers can be present in an individual patient. Lethal metastatic prostate cancer seems to arise from a single clone in the primary tumour but can exhibit subclonal heterogeneity at the genomic, epigenetic and phenotypic levels. Collectively, this complex heterogeneous constellation of molecular alterations poses obstacles for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. However, advances in our understanding of intra-tumoural heterogeneity and the development of novel technologies will allow us to navigate these challenges, refine approaches for translational research and ultimately improve patient care.",

We evaluate sixteen pipelines for reconstructing the evolutionary histories of 293 localized prostate cancers from single samples, and eighteen pipelines for the reconstruction of 10 tumours with multi-region sampling. We show that predictions of subclonal architecture and timing of somatic mutations vary extensively across pipelines. Pipelines show consistent types of biases, with those incorporating SomaticSniper and Battenberg preferentially predicting homogenous cancer cell populations and those using MuTect tending to predict multiple populations of cancer cells. Subclonal reconstructions using multi-region sampling confirm that single-sample reconstructions systematically underestimate intra-tumoural heterogeneity, predicting on average fewer than half of the cancer cell populations identified by multi-region sequencing. Overall, these biases suggest caution in interpreting specific architectures and subclonal variants.",

			"abstract": "Aberrant activation of the Wnt/Fzd/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway is one of the major molecular mechanisms of colorectal cancer (CRC) development and progression. On the other hand, one of the most common clinical CRC characteristics include high levels of angiogenesis, which is a key event in cancer cell dissemination and distant metastasis. The canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin downstream signaling regulates the most important pro-angiogenic molecules including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family members, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and chemokines. Furthermore, mutations of the \u03b2-catenin gene associated with nuclear localization of the protein have been mainly detected in microsatellite unstable CRC. Elevated nuclear \u03b2-catenin increases the expression of many genes involved in tumor angiogenesis. Factors regulating angiogenesis with the participation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling include different groups of biologically active molecules including Wnt pathway components (e.g., Wnt2, DKK, BCL9 proteins), and non-Wnt pathway factors (e.g., chemoattractant cytokines, enzymatic proteins, and bioactive compounds of plants). Several lines of evidence argue for the use of angiogenesis inhibition in the treatment of CRC. In the context of this paper, components of the Wnt pathway are among the most promising targets for CRC therapy. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the role of the Wnt/Fzd/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in the process of CRC angiogenesis, aiming to improve the understanding of the mechanisms of metastasis as well as improvements in the management of this cancer.",

We posit that different genomic aberrations generally exhibit a temporal order, shaped by a balance between the levels of mutations and selective pressures. Repeat instability emerges first, followed by larger aberrations, with compensatory effects leading to robust tumour fitness maintained throughout the tumour progression. A better understanding of the interplay between genetic aberrations, the microenvironment, and epigenetic and metabolic cellular states is essential for early detection and prevention of cancer as well as development of efficient therapeutic strategies.",

There is concern, however, that nutlin therapy might stimulate the emergence or expansion of TP53-mutated subclones. We recently published the results of a phase 1 trial of idasanutlin in patients with polycythemia vera (PV) that revealed tolerability and clinical activity. Here, we present data indicating that idasanutlin therapy is associated with expansion of TP53 mutant subclones. End-of-study sequencing of patients found that 5 patients in this trial harbored 12 TP53 mutations; however, only 1 patient had been previously identified as having a TP53 mutation at baseline. To identify the origin of these mutations, further analysis of raw sequencing data of baseline samples was performed and revealed that a subset of these mutations was present at baseline and expanded during treatment with idasanutlin. Follow-up samples were obtained from 4 of 5 patients in this cohort, and we observed that after cessation of idasanutlin, the variant allele frequency (VAF) of 8 of 9 TP53 mutations decreased. Furthermore, disease progression to myelofibrosis or myeloproliferative neoplasm blast phase was not observed in any of these patients after 19- to 32-month observation. These data suggest that idasanutlin treatment may promote transient TP53 mutant clonal expansion. A larger study geared toward high-resolution detection of low VAF mutations is required to explore whether patients acquire de novo TP53 mutations after idasanutlin therapy.",

			"abstract": "With the rapid development of next-generation sequencing technology, chromosome structural variation has gradually gained increased clinical significance in tumorigenesis. However, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying this structural variation remain poorly understood. A search of the literature shows that a three-dimensional chromatin state plays a vital role in inducing structural variation and in the gene expression profiles in tumorigenesis. Structural variants may result in changes in copy number or deletions of coding sequences, as well as the perturbation of structural chromatin features, especially topological domains, and disruption of interactions between genes and their regulatory elements. This review focuses recent work aiming at elucidating how structural variations develop and misregulate oncogenes and tumor suppressors, to provide general insights into tumor formation mechanisms and to provide potential targets for future anticancer therapies.",

			"abstract": "The rates and patterns by which cells acquire mutations profoundly shape their evolutionary trajectories and phenotypic potential. Conventional models maintain that mutations are acquired independently of one another over many successive generations. Yet, recent evidence suggests that cells can also experience mutagenic processes that drive rapid genome evolution. One such process manifests as punctuated bursts of genomic instability, in which multiple new mutations are acquired simultaneously during transient episodes of genomic instability. This mutational mode is reminiscent of the theory of punctuated equilibrium, proposed by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge in 1972 to explain the burst-like appearance of new species in the fossil record. In this review, we survey the dominant and emerging theories of eukaryotic genome evolution with a particular focus on the growing body of work that substantiates the existence and importance of punctuated bursts of genomic instability. In addition, we summarize and discuss two recent studies from our own group, the results of which indicate that punctuated bursts systemic genomic instability (SGI) can rapidly reconfigure the structure of the diploid genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",

			"abstract": "Principled computational approaches for tumor phylogeny reconstruction via single-cell sequencing typically aim to build the most likely perfect phylogeny tree from the noisy genotype matrix - which represents genotype calls of single cells. This problem is NP-hard, and as a result, existing approaches aim to solve relatively small instances of it through combinatorial optimization techniques or Bayesian inference. As expected, even when the goal is to infer basic topological features of the tumor phylogeny, rather than reconstructing the topology entirely, these approaches could be prohibitively slow. In this paper, we introduce fast deep learning solutions to the problems of inferring whether the most likely tree has a linear (chain) or branching topology and whether a perfect phylogeny is feasible from a given genotype matrix. We also present a reinforcement learning approach for reconstructing the most likely tumor phylogeny. This preliminary work demonstrates that data-driven approaches can reconstruct key features of tumor evolution.",

			"abstract": "The malignant tumor is a complex heterogeneous set of cells functioning in a no less heterogeneous microenvironment. Like any dynamic system, cancerous tumors evolve and undergo changes in response to external influences, including therapy. Initially, most tumors are susceptible to treatment. However, remaining cancer cells may rapidly reestablish the tumor after a temporary remission. These new populations of malignant cells usually have increased resistance not only to the first-line agent, but also to the second- and third-line drugs, leading to a significant decrease in patient survival. Multiple studies describe the mechanism of acquired therapy resistance. In past decades, it became clear that, in addition to the simple selection of pre-existing resistant clones, therapy induces a highly complicated and tightly regulated molecular response that allows tumors to adapt to current and even subsequent therapeutic interventions. This review summarizes mechanisms of acquired resistance, such as secondary genetic alterations, impaired function of drug transporters, and autophagy. Moreover, we describe less obvious molecular aspects of therapy resistance in cancers, including epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, cell cycle alterations, and the role of intercellular communication. Understanding these molecular mechanisms will be beneficial in finding novel therapeutic approaches for cancer therapy.",

			"abstract": "The identification of individual or clusters of predictive genetic alterations might help in defining the outcome of cancer treatment, allowing for the stratification of patients into distinct cohorts for selective therapeutic protocols. Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial childhood tumour, clinically defined in five distinct stages (1-4 & 4S), where stages 3-4 define chemotherapy-resistant, highly aggressive disease phases. NB is a model for geneticists and molecular biologists to classify genetic abnormalities and identify causative disease genes. Despite highly intensive basic research, improvements on clinical outcome have been predominantly observed for less aggressive cancers, that is stages 1,2 and 4S. Therefore, stages 3-4 NB are still complicated at the therapeutic level and require more intense fundamental research. Using neuroblastoma as a model system, here we herein outline how cancer prediction studies can help at steering preclinical and clinical research toward the identification and exploitation of specific genetic landscape. This might result in maximising the therapeutic success and minimizing harmful effects in cancer patients.",

			"abstract": "Tumors are highly heterogeneous, consisting of cell populations with both transcriptional and genetic diversity. These diverse cell populations are spatially organized within a tumor, creating a distinct tumor microenvironment. A new technology called spatial transcriptomics can measure spatial patterns of gene expression within a tissue by sequencing RNA transcripts from a grid of spots, each containing a small number of cells. In tumor cells, these gene expression patterns represent the combined contribution of regulatory mechanisms, which alter the rate at which a gene is transcribed, and genetic diversity, particularly copy number aberrations (CNAs) which alter the number of copies of a gene in the genome. CNAs are common in tumors and often promote cancer growth through upregulation of oncogenes or downregulation of tumor-suppressor genes. We introduce a new method STARCH (spatial transcriptomics algorithm reconstructing copy-number heterogeneity) to infer CNAs from spatial transcriptomics data. STARCH overcomes challenges in inferring CNAs from RNA-sequencing data by leveraging the observation that cells located nearby in a tumor are likely to share similar CNAs. We find that STARCH outperforms existing methods for inferring CNAs from RNA-sequencing data without incorporating spatial information.",

Large collaborative efforts have resulted in the identification and improved understanding of causal factors, and have shed light on new opportunities to prevent cancer. In this new era in cancer genomics, discoveries from studies conducted on an international scale can inform evidence-based strategies in cancer control along the cancer care continuum, from prevention to treatment. In this Review, we present the relevant history and emerging frontiers of cancer genetics and genomics from the perspective of global cancer prevention. We highlight the importance of local context in the adoption of new technologies and emergent evidence, with illustrative examples from worldwide. We emphasize the challenges in implementing important genomic findings in clinical settings with disparate resource availability and present a conceptual framework for the translation of such findings into clinical practice, and evidence-based policies in order to maximize the utility for a population.",

These emerging subclones present a challenge, providing reservoirs for chemoresistant mutations. Technological advancement is required to track MM subclonal changes, as understanding MM's mechanism of evolution at the cellular level can prompt the development of new targeted ways of treating this disease. Current methods to study the evolution of subclones in MM rely on technologies capable of phenotypically and genotypically characterizing plasma cells, which include immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, or cytogenetics. Still, all of these technologies may be limited by the sensitivity for picking up rare events. In contrast, more incisive methods such as RNA sequencing, comparative genomic hybridization, or whole-genome sequencing are not yet commonly used in clinical practice. Here we introduce the epidemiological diagnosis and prognosis of MM and review current methods for evaluating MM subclone evolution, such as minimal residual disease/multiparametric flow cytometry/next-generation sequencing, and their respective advantages and disadvantages. In addition, we propose our new single-cell method of evaluation to understand MM's mechanism of evolution at the molecular and cellular level and to prompt the development of new targeted ways of treating this disease, which has a broad prospect.",

			"abstract": "The dominant paradigm holds that spontaneous and therapeutically induced anti-tumor responses are mediated mainly by CD8 T cells and directed against tumor-specific antigens (TSAs). The presence of specific TSAs on cancer cells can only be proven by mass spectrometry analyses. Bioinformatic predictions and reverse immunology studies cannot provide this type of conclusive evidence. Most TSAs are coded by unmutated non-canonical transcripts that arise from cancer-specific epigenetic and splicing aberrations. When searching for TSAs, it is therefore important to perform mass spectrometry analyses that interrogate not only the canonical reading frame of annotated exome but all reading frames of the entire translatome. The majority of aberrantly expressed TSAs (aeTSAs) derive from unstable short-lived proteins that are good substrates for direct major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I presentation but poor substrates for cross-presentation. This is an important caveat, because cancer cells are poor antigen-presenting cells, and the immune system, therefore, depends on cross-presentation by dendritic cells (DCs) to detect the presence of TSAs. We, therefore, postulate that, in the untreated host, most aeTSAs are undetected by the immune system. We present evidence suggesting that vaccines inducing direct aeTSA presentation by DCs may represent an attractive strategy for cancer treatment.",

Deriving these karyotypes from high-throughput DNA sequencing of bulk tumor samples is complicated because most tumors are a heterogeneous mixture of normal cells and subpopulations of cancer cells, or clones, that harbor distinct somatic mutations. We introduce a new algorithm, Reconstructing Cancer Karyotypes (RCK), to reconstruct haplotype-specific karyotypes of one or more rearranged cancer genomes from DNA sequencing data from a bulk tumor sample. RCK leverages evolutionary constraints on the somatic mutational process in cancer to reduce ambiguity in the deconvolution of admixed sequencing data into multiple haplotype-specific cancer karyotypes. RCK models mixtures containing an arbitrary number of derived genomes and allows the incorporation of information both from short-read and long-read DNA sequencing technologies. We compare RCK to existing approaches on 17 primary and metastatic prostate cancer samples. We find that RCK infers cancer karyotypes that better explain the DNA sequencing data and conform to a reasonable evolutionary model. RCK's reconstructions of clone- and haplotype-specific karyotypes will aid further studies of the role of intra-tumor heterogeneity in cancer development and response to treatment.

Subclonal reconstruction methods based on machine learning aim to separate those subpopulations in a sample and infer their evolutionary history. However, current approaches are entirely data driven and agnostic to evolutionary theory. We demonstrate that systematic errors occur in the analysis if evolution is not accounted for, and this is exacerbated with multi-sampling of the same tumor. We present a novel approach for model-based tumor subclonal reconstruction, called MOBSTER, which combines machine learning with theoretical population genetics. Using public whole-genome sequencing data from 2,606 samples from different cohorts, new data and synthetic validation, we show that this method is more robust and accurate than current techniques in single-sample, multiregion and longitudinal data. This approach minimizes the confounding factors of nonevolutionary methods, thus leading to more accurate recovery of the evolutionary history of human cancers.",

Recently, due to the introduction of next-generation sequencing and projects generating \"Big Data\", a plethora of new genetic variants in pharmacogenes have been discovered. Cancer resistance is a major complication often preventing successful anticancer treatments. Pharmacogenomics of both somatic mutations in tumor cells and germline variants may help optimize targeted treatments and improve the response to conventional oncological therapy. In addition, integrative approaches combining copy number variations and long noncoding RNA profiling with germline and somatic variations seem to be a promising approach as well. In pharmacology, expression and enzyme activity are traditionally the more studied aspects of ATP-binding cassette transporters and cytochromes P450. In this review, we briefly introduce the field of pharmacogenomics and the advancements driven by next-generation sequencing and outline the possible roles of genetic variation in the two large pharmacogene superfamilies. Although the evidence needs further substantiation, somatic and copy number variants as well as rare variants and common polymorphisms in these genes could all affect response to cancer therapy. Regulation by long noncoding RNAs has also been shown to play a role. However, in all these areas, more comprehensive studies on larger sets of patients are needed.",

A comprehensive proteome analysis of human serum/plasma with high-quality data and compelling interpretation can potentially provide opportunities for understanding disease mechanisms, although several challenges will have to be met. Serum/plasma proteome biomarkers are present in very low abundance, and there is high complexity involved due to the heterogeneity of cancers, for which there is a compelling need to develop sensitive and specific proteomic technologies and analytical platforms.

Targeted screening of high-risk individuals is likely to be the most cost-effective strategy to maximize the benefits and reduce the harms of screening. However, the size of the benefit of earlier initiation of treatment and the overall cost-effectiveness of screening remains uncertain. The optimal screening modality and target population is also unclear, and uncertainties exist regarding the specification and implementation of a screening programme. Before moving to a fully powered trial of screening, future work should focus on the following: developing and validating accurate risk prediction models; developing non-invasive methods of early RCC detection; establishing the feasibility, public acceptability and potential uptake of screening; establishing the prevalence of RCC and stage distribution of RCC detected by screening; and evaluating the potential harms of screening, including the impact on quality of life, overdiagnosis and over-treatment.",

Persistent antigen leads to CD8 T-cell exhaustion, where proliferation/self-renewal and killing are divided within distinct subsets of CD8 T cells in the tumor. CD8 T-cell responses in chronic antigen settings must be maintained for long periods of time, suggesting that mechanisms that regulate chronic CD8 T-cell responses may differ from those in acute settings. Currently, factors that regulate the maintenance of stem-like CD8 T cells in the tumor or their differentiation into terminally differentiated cells are unknown. In this review, we discuss the role of dendritic cells in the activation and differentiation of CD8 T-cell subsets within secondary lymphoid tissue and tumors. In addition, we examine changes in CD4 T-cell differentiation in response to chronic antigens and consider how subset-specific mechanisms could assist the stem-like and terminally differentiated CD8 T-cell subsets. Finally, we highlight how tumor-infiltrating CD4 T cells and dendritic cells interact with CD8 T cells within organized lymphoid-like areas in the tumor and propose a CD8 T-cell differentiation model that requires the collaboration of CD4 T cells and dendritic cells. These organized interactions coordinate the anti-tumor response and control disease progression by mechanisms that regulate CD8 T-cell differentiation, which permit the maintenance of an effective balance of stem-like and terminally differentiated CD8 T cells.",

In this Review, we discuss emerging analytic and experimental technologies for single-cell multi-omics that enable the capture and integration of multiple data modalities to inform the study of cancer evolution. These data show that cancer results from a complex interplay between genetic and non-genetic determinants of somatic evolution.",

Chemo-resistance to this drug is common and has been attributed to a variety of distinct mechanisms, involving\u2009>\u2009100 genes. A recently developed small-molecule G-quadruplex ligand, the trisubstituted naphthalene diimide compound CM03, has previously been shown to have equivalent potency to gemcitabine in the pancreatic cancer cell line MIA PaCa-2. We report here on cell lines of increased resistance to gemcitabine that have been generated from this line, with the most resistant having 1,000-fold reduced sensitivity to gemcitabine. These resistant lines retain nM sensitivity to CM03. The molecular basis for the retention of potency by this G-quadruplex ligand has been examined using whole transcriptome data analysis with RNA-seq. This has revealed that the pattern of pathways down\u00a0regulated by CM03 in the parental MIA PaCa-2 cell line is largely unaffected in the gemcitabine-resistant line. The analysis has also shown that the expression patterns of numerous genes involved in gemcitabine sensitivity are down regulated in the resistant line upon CM03 treatment. These results are supportive of the concept that G-quadruplex small molecules such as CM03 have potential for clinical use in the treatment of gemcitabine-resistant human pancreatic cancer.",

The average mutation rate of affected colonic epithelial cells is 2.4-fold that of healthy colon, and this increase is mostly driven by acceleration of mutational processes ubiquitously observed in normal colon. In contrast to the normal colon, where clonal expansions outside the confines of the crypt are rare, we observed widespread millimeter-scale clonal expansions. We discovered non-synonymous mutations in ARID1A, FBXW7, PIGR, ZC3H12A, and genes in the interleukin 17 and Toll-like receptor pathways, under positive selection in IBD.

Cancers with few changes in the exon regions have unclear characteristics, even though low-mutated tumors are often detected in pan-cancer analysis. In the present study, we analyzed tumors with low tumor mutational burden listed in the Japanese version of The Cancer Genome Atlas, a data set of 5020 primary solid tumors. Our analysis revealed that detection rates of known driver mutations and copy number variation were decreased in samples with tumor mutational burden below 1.0 (ultralow tumor), compared with those in samples with low tumor mutational burden (\u22645 mutations/Mb). This trend was also observed in The Cancer Genome Atlas data set. In the ultralow tumor mutational burden tumors, expression analysis showed decreased TP53 inactivation and chromosomal instability. TP53 inactivation frequently correlated with PI3K/mTOR-related gene expression, implying suppression of the PI3K/mTOR pathway in ultralow tumor mutational burden tumors. In common with mutational burden, the T cell-inflamed gene expression profiling signature was a potential marker for prediction of an immune checkpoint inhibitor response, and some ultralow tumor mutational burden tumor populations highly expressed this signature. Our analysis focused on how these tumors could provide insight into tumors with low somatic alteration that are difficult to detect solely using whole-exome sequencing.",

Copy number profiles, representing the number of copies of each region of a genome, are readily obtained from whole-genome sequencing or microarrays. However, modeling copy number evolution is a substantial challenge, because different CNAs may overlap with one another on the genome. A recent popular model for copy number evolution is the copy number distance (CND), defined as the length of a shortest sequence of deletions and amplifications of contiguous segments that transforms one profile into the other. In the CND, all events contribute equally; however, it is well known that rates of CNAs vary by length, genomic position and type (amplification versus deletion).",

Here we describe how unsupervised gene expression-based classification efforts, amongst which the consensus molecular subtypes (CMS), can stratify patients in biological subgroups associated with distinct disease outcome and responses to therapy. We will discuss what is needed to extend these subtyping efforts to the clinic and we will argue that preclinical models recapitulate CMS subtypes and can be of vital use to increase our understanding of treatment response and resistance and to discover novel targets for therapy.",

Numerical chromosome abnormalities, mainly including aneuploidy and chromosome instability, are caused by chromosome segregation errors in mitosis, whereas structural chromosome abnormalities are a consequence of DNA damage and comprise focal/arm-level chromosome gain or loss. Recent advances have started to unveil the mechanisms by which chromosomal abnormalities can facilitate tumorigenesis and change the cellular fitness and the expression or function of RNAs and proteins. Accumulating evidence suggests that chromosome abnormalities represent a genomic signature that is linked to cancer prognosis and reaction to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. In this review, we discuss the most recent findings on the role of chromosome abnormalities in tumorigenesis and cancer progression, with a particular emphasis on how aneuploidy and chromosome instability influence cancer therapy and prognosis. We also highlight the distribution and clinical application of the structural chromosome abnormalities in various cancer types. A better understanding of the role of chromosome abnormalities will be beneficial to the development of precision oncology and suggest future directions for the field.",

ITH is common in human tumors, with many genetic and phenotypic differences between regions. The roles of ITH in progression are uncertain because many subclones lack discernable driver mutations. ITH can be visualized by mapping mutations onto microscopic sections, where subclones are directly associated with phenotypes, especially the deeper areas with the more invasive cells that confer worst clinical outcomes. Instead of a stepwise hierarchy where subclones segregate by phenotype with later branching subclones in more invasive areas, multiple subclones share superficial and invasive phenotype and are jigsaw arrayed in vertical columns. Phylogeography shows that both early and late subclones extend from the surface to the invasive front, suggesting that founder cells start with phenotypic plasticity and essentially all the drivers necessary to rapidly grow into large invasive tumors.",

We have studied two hot spot TPMs and telomere length (TL) in pNEN and compared the results with clinicopathological information and proliferation-associated miRNA/HDAC expression profiles.

T allele frequency of C250T and C228T TPM was analyzed by pyrosequencing, relative TL as telomeric content by qPCR. In total, five pNEN cases (9%) including four pNETs and one pNEC were identified with TPMs, four cases with exclusive C250T as predominant TPM and one case with both C250T and C228T. T allele frequencies of DNA isolated from adjacent high tumor cell content FFPE tissue varied considerably, which may indicate TPM tumor heterogeneity.

			"abstract": "Our understanding of the rises of animal and cancer multicellularity face the same conceptual hurdles: what makes the clade originate and what makes it diversify. Between the events of origination and diversification lies complex tissue organization that gave rise to novel functionality for organisms and, unfortunately, for malignant transformation in cells. Tissue specialization with distinctly separated cell fates allowed novel functionality at organism level, such as for vertebrate animals, but also involved trade-offs at the cellular level that are potentially disruptive. These trade-offs are under-appreciated and here we discuss how the wide separation of cell phenotypes may contribute to cancer evolution by (a) how factors can reverse differentiated cells into a window of phenotypic plasticity, (b) the reversal to phenotypic plasticity coupled with asexual reproduction occurs in a way that the host cannot adapt, and (c) the power of the transformation factor correlates to the power needed to reverse tissue specialization. The role of reversed cell fate separation for cancer evolution is strengthened by how some tissues and organisms maintain high cell proliferation and plasticity without developing tumours at a corresponding rate. This demonstrates a potential proliferation paradox that requires further explanation. These insights from the cancer field, which observes tissue evolution in real time and closer than any other field, allow inferences to be made on evolutionary events in animal history. If a sweet spot of phenotypic and reproductive versatility is key to transformation, factors stimulating cell fate separation may have promoted also animal diversification on Earth.",

Thus, prior to enabling liquid biopsy applications to reach clinical prime time, understanding how the above mechanistic information can be applied to improve treatment decisions is a key challenge. Here, we provide our perspective on how CTCs can provide mechanistic insights into tumor pathogenesis, as well as on CTC clinical value. In doing so, we aim to (a) describe how CTCs disseminate from the primary tumor, and their link to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT); (b) trace the route of CTCs through the circulation, focusing on tumor self-seeding and the possibility of tertiary metastasis; (c) describe possible mechanisms underlying the enhanced metastatic potential of CTCs; (d) discuss how CTC could provide further information on the tissue of origin, especially in cancer of unknown primary origin. We also provide a comprehensive review of meta-analyses assessing the prognostic significance of CTCs, to highlight the emerging role of CTCs in clinical oncology. We also explore how cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis, using a combination of genomic and phylogenetic analysis, can offer insights into CTC biology, including our understanding of CTC heterogeneity and tumor evolution. Last, we discuss emerging technologies, such as high-throughput quantitative imaging, radiogenomics, machine learning approaches, and the emerging breath biopsy. These technologies could compliment CTC and ctDNA analyses, and they collectively represent major future steps in cancer detection, monitoring, and management.",

			"abstract": "The claudin-low breast cancer subtype is defined by gene expression characteristics and encompasses a remarkably diverse range of breast tumors. Here, we investigate genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical features of claudin-low breast tumors. We show that claudin-low is not simply a subtype analogous to the intrinsic subtypes (basal-like, HER2-enriched, luminal A, luminal B and normal-like) as previously portrayed, but is a complex additional phenotype which may permeate breast tumors of various intrinsic subtypes. Claudin-low tumors are distinguished by low genomic instability, mutational burden and proliferation levels, and high levels of immune and stromal cell infiltration. In other aspects, claudin-low tumors reflect characteristics of their intrinsic subtype. Finally, we explore an alternative method for identifying claudin-low tumors and thereby uncover potential weaknesses in the established claudin-low classifier. In sum, these findings elucidate the heterogeneity in claudin-low breast tumors, and substantiate a re-definition of claudin-low as a cancer phenotype.",

The discovery of current mutational processes for predicting the tumor's evolutionary trajectory requires dense sequencing of individual clones or single cells. Such studies, however, are inherently problematic because of the discovery of excessive false positive (FP) mutations when sequencing picogram quantities of DNA. Data pooling to increase the confidence in the discovered mutations, moves the discovery back in the past to a common ancestor. Here we report a robust WGS and analysis pipeline (DigiPico/MutLX) that virtually eliminates all F results while retaining an excellent proportion of true positives. Using our method, we identified, for the first time, a hyper-mutation (kataegis) event in a group of \u223c30 cancer cells from a recurrent ovarian carcinoma. This was unidentifiable from the bulk WGS data. Overall, we propose DigiPico/MutLX method as a powerful framework for the identification of clone-specific variants at an unprecedented accuracy.",

			"abstract": "The catalog of cancer driver mutations in protein-coding genes has greatly expanded in the past decade. However, non-coding cancer driver mutations are less well-characterized and only a handful of recurrent non-coding mutations, most notably TERT promoter mutations, have been reported. Here, as part of the ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium, which aggregated whole genome sequencing data from 2658 cancer across 38 tumor types, we perform multi-faceted pathway and network analyses of non-coding mutations across 2583 whole cancer genomes from 27 tumor types compiled by the ICGC/TCGA PCAWG project that was motivated by the success of pathway and network analyses in prioritizing rare mutations in protein-coding genes. While few non-coding genomic elements are recurrently mutated in this cohort, we identify 93 genes harboring non-coding mutations that cluster into several modules of interacting proteins. Among these are promoter mutations associated with reduced mRNA expression in TP53, TLE4, and TCF4. We find that biological processes had variable proportions of coding and non-coding mutations, with chromatin remodeling and proliferation pathways altered primarily by coding mutations, while developmental pathways, including Wnt and Notch, altered by both coding and non-coding mutations. RNA splicing is primarily altered by non-coding mutations in this cohort, and samples containing non-coding mutations in well-known RNA splicing factors exhibit similar gene expression signatures as samples with coding mutations in these genes. These analyses contribute a new repertoire of possible cancer genes and mechanisms that are altered by non-coding mutations and offer insights into additional cancer vulnerabilities that can be investigated for potential therapeutic treatments.",

Here, as part of the ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium, which aggregated whole genome sequencing data from 2658 cancers across 38 tumour types, we quantify hypoxia in 1188 tumours spanning 27 cancer types. Elevated hypoxia associates with increased mutational load across cancer types, irrespective of underlying mutational class. The proportion of mutations attributed to several mutational signatures of unknown aetiology directly associates with the level of hypoxia, suggesting underlying mutational processes for these signatures. At the gene level, driver mutations in TP53, MYC and PTEN are enriched in hypoxic tumours, and mutations in PTEN interact with hypoxia to direct tumour evolutionary trajectories. Overall, hypoxia plays a critical role in shaping the genomic and evolutionary landscapes of cancer.",

			"abstract": "Genetic activation of the class I PI3K pathway is very common in cancer. This mostly results from oncogenic mutations in PIK3CA, the gene encoding the ubiquitously expressed PI3K\u03b1 catalytic subunit, or from inactivation of the PTEN tumour suppressor, a lipid phosphatase that opposes class I PI3K signalling. The clinical impact of PI3K inhibitors in solid tumours, aimed at dampening cancer-cell-intrinsic PI3K activity, has thus far been limited. Challenges include poor drug tolerance, incomplete pathway inhibition and pre-existing or inhibitor-induced resistance. The principle of pharmacologically targeting cancer-cell-intrinsic PI3K activity also assumes that all cancer-promoting effects of PI3K activation are reversible, which might not be the case. Emerging evidence suggests that genetic PI3K pathway activation can induce and/or allow cells to tolerate chromosomal instability, which-even if occurring in a low fraction of the cell population-might help to facilitate and/or drive tumour evolution. While it is clear that such genomic events cannot be reverted pharmacologically, a role for PI3K in the regulation of chromosomal instability could be exploited by using PI3K pathway inhibitors to prevent those genomic events from happening and/or reduce the pace at which they are occurring, thereby dampening cancer development or progression. Such an impact might be most effective in tumours with clonal PI3K activation and achievable at lower drug doses than the maximum-tolerated doses of PI3K inhibitors currently used in the clinic.",

We assessed associations between these signatures and clinical characteristics of disease, in addition to recurrence-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Five SBS and two indel signatures were extracted. The SBS13-like signature had higher relative contributions in the HER2-enriched subtype. Patients with higher than median contribution tended to have better RFS after adjustment for other prognostic factors (HR = 0.29; 95% CI: 0.08-1.06). An unsupervised clustering algorithm based on absolute contribution revealed three clusters of fitted COSMIC SBS signatures, but cluster membership was not associated with clinical variables or survival outcomes. The results of this exploratory study reveal various SBS and indel signatures may be associated with clinical features of disease and prognosis.

			"abstract": "Cancer is a disease that many multicellular organisms have faced for millions of years, and species have evolved various tumour suppression mechanisms to control oncogenesis. Although cancer occurs across the tree of life, cancer related mortality risks vary across mammalian orders, with Carnivorans particularly affected. Evolutionary theory predicts different selection pressures on genes associated with cancer progression and suppression, including oncogenes, tumour suppressor genes and immune genes. Therefore, we investigated the evolutionary history of cancer associated gene sequences across 384 mammalian taxa, to detect signatures of selection across categories of oncogenes (GRB2, FGL2 and CDC42), tumour suppressors (LITAF, Casp8 and BRCA2) and immune genes (IL2, CD274 and B2M). This approach allowed us to conduct a fine scale analysis of gene wide and site-specific signatures of selection across mammalian lineages under the lens of cancer susceptibility. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that for most species the evolution of cancer associated genes follows the species' evolution. The gene wide selection analyses revealed oncogenes being the most conserved, tumour suppressor and immune genes having similar amounts of episodic diversifying selection. Despite BRCA2's status as a key caretaker gene, episodic diversifying selection was detected across mammals. The site-specific selection analyses revealed that the two apoptosis associated domains of the Casp8 gene of bats (Chiroptera) are under opposing forces of selection (positive and negative respectively), highlighting the importance of site-specific selection analyses to understand the evolution of highly complex gene families. Our results highlighted the need to critically assess different types of selection pressure on cancer associated genes when investigating evolutionary adaptations to cancer across the tree of life. This study provides an extensive assessment of cancer associated genes in mammals with highly representative, and substantially large sample size for a comparative genomic analysis in the field and identifies various avenues for future research into the mechanisms of cancer resistance and susceptibility in mammals.",

			"abstract": "Neutrophil elastase (NE) is a proteolytic enzyme released extracellular during the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) through degranulation. In addition to participating in the body's inflammatory response, NE also plays an important role in cancer. It can promote tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion, induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and change the tumor microenvironment (TME) to promote tumor progression. Concurrently, NE promotes systemic treatment resistance by inducing EMT. However, it can also selectively kill cancer cells and attenuate tumor development. Sivelestat is a specific NE inhibitor that can be used in the perioperative period of esophageal cancer patients to reduce the incidence of postoperative complications after esophagectomy. In addition, the combination of sivelestat and trastuzumab can enhance the efficacy of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2(HER 2) positive breast cancer patients. Meanwhile, targeting the human antibody domains and fragments of NE is also a new way to treat cancer and inflammation-related diseases. This review provides valuable insights into the role of NE in cancer treatment. Additionally, we discuss the challenges associated with the clinical application of sivelestat. By shedding light on the promising potential of NE, this review contributes to the advancement of cancer treatment strategies.",

			"abstract": "With the advent of immunotherapeutics, a new era in the combat against cancer has begun. Particularly promising are neo-epitope-targeted therapies as the expression of neo-antigens is tumor-specific. In turn, this allows the selective targeting and killing of cancer cells whilst healthy cells remain largely unaffected. So far, many advances have been made in the development of treatment options which are tailored to the individual neo-epitope repertoire. The next big step is the achievement of efficacious \"off-the-shelf\" immunotherapies. For this, shared neo-epitopes propose an optimal target. Given the tremendous potential, a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanisms which lead to the formation of neo-antigens is of fundamental importance. Here, we review the various processes which result in the formation of neo-epitopes. Broadly, the origin of neo-epitopes can be categorized into three groups: canonical, noncanonical, and viral neo-epitopes. For the canonical neo-antigens that arise in direct consequence of somatic mutations, we summarize past and recent findings. Beyond that, our main focus is put on the discussion of noncanonical and viral neo-epitopes as we believe that targeting those provides an encouraging perspective to shape the future of cancer immunotherapeutics.",

We introduce a new bioinformatics method called CoT for deciphering clonal copy number substructure. The backbone of CoT is a Copy number Transformer autoencoder that leverages multi-head attention mechanism to explore correlations between different genomic regions, and thus capture global features to create latent embeddings for the cells. CoT makes it convenient to first infer cell subpopulations based on the learned embeddings, and then estimate single-cell copy numbers through joint analysis of read counts data for the cells belonging to the same cluster. This exploitation of clonal substructure information in copy number analysis helps to alleviate the effect of read counts non-uniformity, and yield robust estimations of the tumor copy numbers. Performance evaluation on synthetic and real datasets showcases that CoT outperforms the state of the arts, and is highly useful for deciphering clonal copy number substructure.",

			"abstract": "Immunotherapies represent one of the current most promising challenges in cancer treatment. They are based on the boost of natural immune responses, aimed at cancer eradication. However, the success of immunotherapeutic approaches strictly depends on the interaction between immune cells and cancer cells. Preclinical drug tests currently available are poor in fully predicting the actual safety and efficacy of immunotherapeutic treatments under development. Indeed, conventional 2D cell culture underrepresents the complexity of the tumour microenvironment, while in vivo animal models lack in mimicking the human immune cell responses. In this context, predictability, reliability, and complete immune compatibility still represent challenges to overcome. For this aim, novel 3D, fully humanized in vitro cancer tissue models have been recently optimized by adopting emerging technologies, such as organ-on-chips (OOC) and 3D cancer cell-laden hydrogels. In particular, a novel multi-in vitro organ (MIVO) OOC platform has been recently adopted to culture 3D clinically relevant size cancer tissues under proper physiological culture conditions to investigate anti-cancer treatments and immune-tumour cell crosstalk.The proposed immune-tumour OOC-based model offers a potential tool for accurately modelling human immune-related diseases and effectively assessing immunotherapy efficacy, finally offering promising experimental approaches for personalized medicine.",

While next-generation sequencing (NGS), which uses short reads, has transformed cancer research and diagnostics, it is limited by read length. Third-generation sequencing (TGS), led by the Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies platforms, employs long-read sequences, which have marked a paradigm shift in cancer research. Cancer genomes often harbour complex events, and TGS, with its ability to span large genomic regions, has facilitated their characterisation, providing a better understanding of how complex rearrangements affect cancer initiation and progression. TGS has also characterised the entire transcriptome of various cancers, revealing cancer-associated isoforms that could serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets. Furthermore, TGS has advanced cancer research by improving genome assemblies, detecting complex variants, and providing a more complete picture of transcriptomes and epigenomes. This review focuses on TGS and its growing role in cancer research. We investigate its advantages and limitations, providing a rigorous scientific analysis of its use in detecting previously hidden aberrations missed by NGS. This promising technology holds immense potential for both research and clinical applications, with far-reaching implications for cancer diagnosis and treatment.",

			"abstract": "Tumors are mostly characterized by genetic instability, as result of mutations in surveillance mechanisms, such as DNA damage checkpoint, DNA repair machinery and mitotic checkpoint. Defect in one or more of these mechanisms causes additive accumulation of mutations. Some of these mutations are drivers of transformation and are positively selected during the evolution of the cancer, giving a growth advantage on the cancer cells. If such mutations would result in mutated neoantigens, these could be actionable targets for cancer vaccines and/or adoptive cell therapies. However, the results of the present analysis show, for the first time, that the most prevalent mutations identified in human cancers do not express mutated neoantigens. The hypothesis is that this is the result of the selection operated by the immune system in the very early stages of tumor development. At that stage, the tumor cells characterized by mutations giving rise to highly antigenic non-self-mutated neoantigens would be efficiently targeted and eliminated. Consequently, the outgrowing tumor cells cannot be controlled by the immune system, with an ultimate growth advantage to form large tumors embedded in an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). The outcome of such a negative selection operated by the immune system is that the development of off-the-shelf vaccines, based on shared mutated neoantigens, does not seem to be at hand. This finding represents the first demonstration of the key role of the immune system on shaping the tumor antigen presentation and the implication in the development of antitumor immunological strategies.",

The precisionFDA team collaborated with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) and successfully completed the NCTR Indel Calling from Oncopanel Sequencing Data Challenge, to evaluate the performance of indel calling pipelines. Top performers were selected based on precision, recall, and F1-score. The performance of many other pipelines was close to the top performers, which produced a top cluster of performers. The performance was significantly higher in high confidence regions and coding regions, and significantly lower in low complexity regions. Oncopanel capture and other issues may have occurred that affected the recall rate. Indels with higher variant allele frequency (VAF) may generally be called with higher confidence. Many of the indel calling pipelines had good performance. Some of them performed generally well across all three oncopanels, while others were better for a specific oncopanel. The performance of indel calling can further be improved by restricting the calls within high confidence intervals (HCIs) and coding regions, and by excluding low complexity regions (LCR) regions. Certain VAF cut-offs could be applied according to the applications.",

In this Perspective article, we summarize the major biological hallmarks underlying sex bias in immuno-oncology. We focus on signalling from sex hormones and chromosome-encoded gene products, along with sex hormone-independent and chromosome-independent epigenetic mechanisms in tumour and immune cells such as myeloid cells and T cells. Finally, we highlight opportunities for future studies on sex differences that integrate sex hormones and chromosomes and other emerging cancer hallmarks such as ageing and the microbiome to provide a more comprehensive view of how sex differences underlie the response in cancer that can be leveraged for more effective immuno-oncology approaches.",

Here we develop a strategy to determine the tumor clonality of three independent HCC cohorts of 524 patients with diverse etiologies and race/ethnicity by utilizing somatic mutations in cancer driver genes. We identify two main types of tumor evolution, i.e., linear, and non-linear models where non-linear type could be further divided into classes, which we call shallow branching and deep branching. We find that linear evolving HCC is less aggressive than other types. GTF2IRD2B mutations are enriched in HCC with linear evolution, while TP53 mutations are the most frequent genetic alterations in HCC with non-linear models. Furthermore, we observe significant B cell enrichment in linear trees compared to non-linear trees suggesting the need for further research to uncover potential variations in immune cell types within genomically determined phylogeny types. These results hint at the possibility that tumor cells and their microenvironment may collectively influence the tumor evolution process.",

This transition has been greatly facilitated through new high-throughput sequencing technologies that can provide the unique molecular profile of each individual patient, along with the rapid development of targeted therapies directed to the Achilles heels of each disease. To implement precision medicine approaches in healthcare, many countries have adopted national strategies and initiated genomic/precision medicine initiatives to provide equal access to all citizens. In other countries, such as Sweden, this has proven more difficult due to regionally organised healthcare. Using a bottom-up approach, key stakeholders from academia, healthcare, industry and patient organisations joined forces and formed Genomic Medicine Sweden (GMS), a national infrastructure for the implementation of precision medicine across the country. To achieve this, Genomic Medicine Centres have been established to provide regionally distributed genomic services, and a national informatics infrastructure has been built to allow secure data handling and sharing. GMS has a broad scope focusing on rare diseases, cancer, pharmacogenomics, infectious diseases and complex diseases, while also providing expertise in informatics, ethical and legal issues, health economy, industry collaboration and education. In this review, we summarise our experience in building a national infrastructure for precision medicine. We also provide key examples how precision medicine already has been successfully implemented within our focus areas. Finally, we bring up challenges and opportunities associated with precision medicine implementation, the importance of international collaboration, as well as the future perspective in the field of precision medicine.",

			"abstract": "Cancer is a complex and evolutionary disease mainly driven by the accumulation of genetic variations in genes. Identifying cancer driver genes is important. However, most related studies have focused on the population level. Cancer is a disease with high heterogeneity. Thus, the discovery of driver genes at the individual level is becoming more valuable but is a great challenge. Although there have been some computational methods proposed to tackle this challenge, few can cover all patient samples well, and there is still room for performance improvement. In this study, to identify individual-level driver genes more efficiently, we propose the PDGCN method. PDGCN integrates multiple types of data features, including mutation, expression, methylation, copy number data, and system-level gene features, along with network structural features extracted using Node2vec in order to construct a sample-gene interaction network. Prediction is performed using a graphical convolutional neural network model with a conditional random field layer, which is able to better combine the network structural features with biological attribute features. Experiments on the ACC (Adrenocortical Cancer) and KICH (Kidney Chromophobe) datasets from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) demonstrated that the method performs better compared to other similar methods. It can identify not only frequently mutated driver genes, but also rare candidate driver genes and novel biomarker genes. The results of the survival and enrichment analyses of these detected genes demonstrate that the method can identify important driver genes at the individual level.",

			"abstract": "Cancer is a complex gene mutation disease that derives from the accumulation of mutations during somatic cell evolution. With the advent of high-throughput technology, a large amount of omics data has been generated, and how to find cancer-related driver genes from a large number of omics data is a challenge. In the early stage, the researchers developed many frequency-based driver genes identification methods, but they could not identify driver genes with low mutation rates well. Afterwards, researchers developed network-based methods by fusing multi-omics data, but they rarely considered the connection among features. In this paper, after analyzing a large number of methods for integrating multi-omics data, a hierarchical weak consensus model for fusing multiple features is proposed according to the connection among features. By analyzing the connection between PPI network and co-mutation hypergraph network, this paper firstly proposes a new topological feature, called co-mutation clustering coefficient (CMCC). Then, a hierarchical weak consensus model is used to integrate CMCC, mRNA and miRNA differential expression scores, and a new driver genes identification method HWC is proposed. In this paper, the HWC method and current 7 state-of-the-art methods are compared on three types of cancers. The comparison results show that HWC has the best identification performance in statistical evaluation index, functional consistency and the partial area under ROC curve.",

While there is growing evidence suggesting an interplay between germline and somatic variants, and a substantial number of somatic aberrations in specific pathways are now recognized as hallmarks in many well-known forms of cancer, the interaction landscape between germline variants and the aberration of those pathways in cancer remains largely unexplored. Utilizing over 8500 human samples across 33 cancer types characterized by TCGA and considering binary traits defined using a large collection of somatic aberration profiles across ten well-known oncogenic signaling pathways, we conducted a series of GWAS and identified genome-wide and suggestive associations involving 276 SNPs. Among these, 94 SNPs revealed cis-eQTL links with cancer-related genes or with genes functionally correlated with the corresponding traits' oncogenic pathways. GWAS summary statistics for all tested traits were then used to construct a set of polygenic scores employing a customized computational strategy. Polygenic scores for 24 traits demonstrated significant performance and were validated using data from PCAWG and CCLE datasets. These scores showed prognostic value for clinical variables and exhibited significant effectiveness in classifying patients into specific cancer subtypes or stratifying patients with cancer-specific aggressive phenotypes. Overall, we demonstrate that germline genetics can describe patients' genetic liability to develop specific cancer molecular and clinical profiles.",

In this study, we employ several techniques to map DSBs, R-loops, and topoisomerase 1 cleavage complex (TOP1cc) to comprehensively investigate the interplay between transcription, DSBs, topoisomerase 1 (TOP1), and R-loops. Our findings reveal the presence of DSBs at highly expressed genes enriched with TOP1 and R-loops. Remarkably, transcription-associated DSBs at these loci are significantly reduced upon depletion of R-loops and TOP1, uncovering the pivotal roles of TOP1 and R-loops in transcriptional DSB formation. By elucidating the intricate interplay between TOP1cc trapping, R-loops, and DSBs, our study provides insights into the mechanisms underlying transcription-associated genomic instability. Moreover, we establish a link between transcriptional DSBs and early molecular changes driving cancer development, highlighting the distinct etiology and molecular characteristics of driver mutations compared to passenger mutations.",

Using large-scale whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of clones expanded from irradiated murine and\u00a0human single cells, we revealed that IR induces a characteristic spectrum of short insertions or deletions (indels) and structural variations (SVs), including balanced inversions, translocations, composite SVs (deletion-insertion, deletion-inversion, and deletion-translocation composites), and complex genomic rearrangements (CGRs), including chromoplexy, chromothripsis, and SV by breakage-fusion-bridge cycles. Our findings suggest that 1\u00a0Gy IR exposure causes an average of 2.33 mutational events per Gb genome, comprising 2.15 indels, 0.17 SVs, and 0.01 CGRs, despite a high level of inter-cellular stochasticity. The mutational burden was dependent on total irradiation dose, regardless of dose rate or cell type. The findings were further validated in IR-induced secondary cancers and single cells without clonalization.

			"abstract": "The current situation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) management is challenging due to its high incidence, mortality, recurrence and metastasis. Recent advances in gene genetic and expression regulation have unveiled the significant role of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) in various cancers. This led to the formulation of the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis, which posits that both coding RNA and ncRNA, containing miRNA response elements (MRE), can share the same miRNA sequence. This results in a competitive network between ncRNAs, such as lncRNA and mRNA, allowing them to regulate each other. Extensive research has highlighted the crucial role of the ceRNA network in HCC development, impacting various cellular processes including proliferation, metastasis, cell death, angiogenesis, tumor microenvironment, organismal immunity, and chemotherapy resistance. Additionally, the ceRNA network, mediated by lncRNA or circRNA, offers potential in early diagnosis and prevention of HCC. Consequently, ceRNAs are emerging as therapeutic targets for HCC. The complexity of these gene networks aligns with the multi-target approach of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), presenting a novel perspective for TCM in combating HCC. Research is beginning to show that TCM compounds and prescriptions can affect HCC progression through the ceRNA network, inhibiting proliferation and metastasis, and inducing apoptosis. Currently, the lncRNAs TUG1, NEAT1, and CCAT1, along with their associated ceRNA networks, are among the most promising ncRNAs for HCC research. However, this field is still in its infancy, necessitating advanced technology and extensive basic research to fully understand the ceRNA network mechanisms of TCM in HCC treatment.",

Targeted therapies aimed at key oncogenic driver mutations in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy as well as immunotherapy have benefited cancer patients considerably. Tumor protein p53 (TP53), a crucial tumor suppressor gene encoding p53, regulates numerous downstream genes and cellular phenotypes in response to various stressors. The affected genes are involved in diverse processes, including cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, cellular senescence, metabolic homeostasis, apoptosis, and autophagy. However, accumulating recent studies have continued to reveal novel and unexpected functions of p53 in governing the fate of tumors, for example, functions in ferroptosis, immunity, the tumor microenvironment and microbiome metabolism. Among the possibilities, the evolutionary plasticity of p53 is the most controversial, partially due to the dizzying array of biological functions that have been attributed to different regulatory mechanisms of p53 signaling. Nearly 40 years after its discovery, this key tumor suppressor remains somewhat enigmatic. The intricate and diverse functions of p53 in regulating cell fate during cancer treatment are only the tip of the iceberg with respect to its equally complicated structural biology, which has been painstakingly revealed. Additionally, TP53 mutation is one of the most significant genetic alterations in cancer, contributing to rapid cancer cell growth and tumor progression. Here, we summarized recent advances that implicate altered p53 in modulating the response to various cancer therapies, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. Furthermore, we also discussed potential strategies for targeting p53 as a therapeutic option for cancer.",

SIN3a serves as a scaffold protein and facilitates interactions with transcriptional epigenetic partners and specific DNA-binding transcription factors to modulate gene expression by adding or removing epigenetic marks. However, the activation or repression of gene expression depends on the factors that interact with SIN3a, as it can recruit both transcriptional activators and repressors. The role of SIN3a has been extensively investigated in the context of cancer, including melanoma, lung, and breast cancer. Our group is interested in defining the roles of SIN3a and its partners in pulmonary vascular disease. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a multifactorial disease often described as a cancer-like disease and characterized by disrupted cellular metabolism, sustained vascular cell proliferation, and resistance to apoptosis. Molecularly, PAH shares many common signaling pathways with cancer cells, offering the opportunity to further consider therapeutic strategies used for cancer. As a result, many signaling pathways observed in cancer were studied in PAH and have encouraged new research studying SIN3a's role in PAH due to its impact on cancer growth. This comparison offers new therapeutic options. In this review, we delineate the SIN3a-associated epigenetic mechanisms in cancer and PAH cells and highlight their impact on cell survival and proliferation. Furthermore, we explore in detail the role of SIN3a in cancer to provide new insights into its emerging role in PAH pathogenesis.",

Using this signature, we develop a machine-learning classifier to identify tumors with hitherto unknown POLE drivers and validate two drivers, POLE-E978G and POLE-S461L, by functional assays in yeast. Unlike other pathogenic variants, the E978G substitution affects the polymerase domain of Pol \u03b5.

			"abstract": "The discovery of subtypes is pivotal for disease diagnosis and targeted therapy, considering the diverse responses of different cells or patients to specific treatments. Exploring the heterogeneity within disease or cell states provides insights into disease progression mechanisms and cell differentiation. The advent of high-throughput technologies has enabled the generation and analysis of various molecular data types, such as single-cell RNA-seq, proteomic, and imaging datasets, at large scales. While presenting opportunities for subtype discovery, these datasets pose challenges in finding relevant signatures due to their high dimensionality. Feature selection, a crucial step in the analysis pipeline, involves choosing signatures that reduce the feature size for more efficient downstream computational analysis. Numerous existing methods focus on selecting signatures that differentiate known diseases or cell states, yet they often fall short in identifying features that preserve heterogeneity and reveal subtypes. To identify features that can capture the diversity within each class while also maintaining the discrimination of known disease states, we employed deep metric learning-based feature embedding to conduct a detailed exploration of the statistical properties of features essential in preserving heterogeneity. Our analysis revealed that features with a significant difference in interquartile range (IQR) between classes possess crucial subtype information. Guided by this insight, we developed a robust statistical method, termed PHet (Preserving Heterogeneity) that performs iterative subsampling differential analysis of IQR and Fisher's method between classes, identifying a minimal set of heterogeneity-preserving discriminative features to optimize subtype clustering quality. Validation using public single-cell RNA-seq and microarray datasets showcased PHet's effectiveness in preserving sample heterogeneity while maintaining discrimination of known disease/cell states, surpassing the performance of previous outlier-based methods. Furthermore, analysis of a single-cell RNA-seq dataset from mouse tracheal epithelial cells revealed, through PHet-based features, the presence of two distinct basal cell subtypes undergoing differentiation toward a luminal secretory phenotype. Notably, one of these subtypes exhibited high expression of BPIFA1. Interestingly, previous studies have linked BPIFA1 secretion to the emergence of secretory cells during mucociliary differentiation of airway epithelial cells. PHet successfully pinpointed the basal cell subtype associated with this phenomenon, a distinction that pre-annotated markers and dispersion-based features failed to make due to their admixed feature expression profiles. These findings underscore the potential of our method to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms underlying diseases and cell differentiation and contribute significantly to personalized medicine.",

			"abstract": "Background In the field of precision oncology, comprehensive genomic profiling tests play a very important role by providing a complex understanding of the molecular characteristics of malignant tumors. Therefore, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become a valuable tool in various aspects of cancer care from diagnosis and monitoring to treatment selection and personalized cancer treatment. Our aim was to evaluate the role of tumor molecular profiling in tailored treatment selection. Methods In our study, we conducted a retrospective analysis to assess the practicality of utilizing NGS testing in patients with metastatic solid tumors. The genomic testing was performed on blood or tissue samples from a fresh biopsy, less than six months old, and the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Results A total of 75 tests were performed on 66 patients between 2019 and 2022, with a success rate of 80%. The most common pathologies were gastro-intestinal tract cancer (26%), breast cancer (14%), non-small cell lung cancer (11%), and pancreatic cancer\u00a0(11%). There were 9% liquid biopsies and 91% tissue biopsies.\u00a0From all 66 patients tested, 55 had at least one genetic alteration. The most frequent genetic alteration found was TP53 (n=32) followed by KRAS (n=15) and BRCA1/2 (n=12) mutations. There were nine patients tested (14%) that presented a high tumor mutational burden, and only one patient presented high microsatellite instability.\u00a0There were 37 patients (56%) with actionable alterations found from which 14 received matched therapy and four patients were enrolled in clinical trials. The NGS testing played a significant role in determining the next therapeutic strategy in 20 out of 66 patients (30.3%). Conclusion From all the patients included in our analysis, 83% had at least one mutation that is known to be of pathogenic significance but only 23% received treatment selected by the analysis of the tumor's genome, and only 6% were included in a clinical trial. This moderate success of personalized medicine using NGS testing highlights the importance of evaluating the factors that could lead to further improvement.",

			"abstract": "Cancer is known as a heterogeneous disease. Cancer driver genes (CDGs) need to be inferred for understanding tumor heterogeneity in cancer. However, the existing computational methods have identified many common CDGs. A key challenge exploring cancer progression is to infer cancer subtype-specific driver genes (CSDGs), which provides guidane for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of cancer. The significant advancements in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have opened up new possibilities for studying human cancers at the individual cell level. In this study, we develop a novel unsupervised method, CSDGI (Cancer Subtype-specific Driver Gene Inference), which applies Encoder-Decoder-Framework consisting of low-rank residual neural networks to inferring driver genes corresponding to potential cancer subtypes at the single-cell level. To infer CSDGs, we apply CSDGI to the tumor single-cell transcriptomics data. To filter the redundant genes before driver gene inference, we perform the differential expression genes (DEGs). The experimental results demonstrate CSDGI is effective to infer driver genes that are cancer subtype-specific. Functional and disease enrichment analysis shows these inferred CSDGs indicate the key biological processes and disease pathways. CSDGI is the first method to explore cancer driver genes at the cancer subtype level. We believe that it can be a useful method to understand the mechanisms of cell transformation driving tumours.",

			"abstract": "Cancer, an intricate and multifaceted disease, is characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of cells that can lead to serious health complications and ultimately death. Conventional therapeutic strategies mainly target rapidly dividing cancer cells, but often indiscriminately harm healthy cells in the process. As a result, there is a growing interest in exploring novel therapies that are both effective and less toxic to normal cells. Herbs have long been used as natural remedies for various diseases and conditions. Some herbal compounds exhibit potent anti-cancer properties, making them potential candidates for nutraceutical-based treatments. However, despite their promising efficacy, there are considerable limitations in utilizing herbal preparations due to their poor solubility, low bioavailability, rapid metabolism and excretion, as well as potential interference with other medications. Nanotechnology offers a unique platform to overcome these challenges by encapsulating herbal compounds within nanoparticles. This approach not only increases solubility and stability but also enhances the cellular uptake of nutraceuticals, allowing for controlled and targeted delivery of therapeutic agents directly at tumor sites. By harnessing the power of nanotechnology-enabled therapy, this new frontier in cancer treatment presents an opportunity to minimize toxicity while maximizing efficacy. In conclusion, this manuscript provides compelling evidence for integrating nanotechnology with nutraceuticals derived from herbal sources to optimize cancer therapy outcomes. We explore the roadblocks associated with traditional herbal treatments and demonstrate how nanotechnology can help circumvent these issues, paving the way for safer and more effective cancer interventions in future oncological practice.",

MRTs are genetically defined by bi-allelic inactivating mutations in SMARCB1, a member of the BRG1/BRM-associated factors (BAF) chromatin remodeling complex. Mutations in BAF complex members are common in human cancer, yet their contribution to tumorigenesis remains in many cases poorly understood. Here, we study derailed regulatory landscapes as a consequence of SMARCB1 loss in the context of MRT. Our multi-omics approach on patient-derived MRT organoids reveals a dramatic reshaping of the regulatory landscape upon SMARCB1 reconstitution. Chromosome conformation capture experiments subsequently reveal patient-specific looping of distal enhancer regions with the promoter of the MYC oncogene. This intertumoral heterogeneity in MYC enhancer utilization is also present in patient MRT tissues as shown by combined single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq. We show that loss of SMARCB1 activates patient-specific epigenetic reprogramming underlying MRT tumorigenesis.",

A gene regulatory network (GRN) formed by a set of ten genes that are believed to play an important role in breast cancer development was kinetically coupled to the microenvironmental agents: glucose, estrogens, and oxygen. The dynamics of spontaneous mutations was described by a Yule-Furry master equation whose solution represents the probability that a given cell in the tissue undergoes a certain number of mutations at a given time. We assumed that the mutation rate is modified by a spatial gradient of nutrients. The tumor mass was simulated by means of cellular automata supplemented with a set of reaction diffusion equations that described the transport of microenvironmental agents. By analyzing the epigenetic state space described by the GRN dynamics, we found three attractors that were identified with cellular epigenetic states: normal, precancer and cancer. For two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) tumors we calculated the spatial distribution of the following quantities: (i) number of mutations, (ii) mutation of each gene and, (iii) phenotypes. Using estrogen as the principal microenvironmental agent that regulates cell proliferation process, we obtained tumor shapes for different values of estrogen consumption and supply rates. It was found that he majority of mutations occurred in cells that were located close to the 2D tumor perimeter or close to the 3D tumor surface. Also, it was found that the occurrence of different phenotypes in the tumor are controlled by estrogen concentration levels since they can change the individual cell threshold and gene expression levels. All results were consistently observed for 2D and 3D tumors.",

Through immunohistochemistry, the overexpression of SPRYD7 was observed to be associated with the poor survival of CRC patients and with an aggressive and metastatic phenotype. Stable SPRYD7 overexpression was performed in KM12C and SW480 poorly metastatic CRC cells and in their isogenic highly metastatic-to-liver-KM12SM-and-to-lymph-nodes SW620 CRC cells, respectively. Upon upregulation of SPRYD7, in vitro and in vivo functional assays confirmed a key role of SPRYD7 in the invasion and migration of CRC cells and in liver homing and tumor growth. Additionally, transient siRNA SPRYD7 silencing allowed us to confirm in vitro functional results. Furthermore, SPRYD7 was observed as an inductor of angiogenesis. In addition, the dysregulated SPRYD7-associated proteome and SPRYD7 interactors were elucidated via 10-plex TMT quantitative proteins, immunoproteomics, and bioinformatics. After WB validation, the biological pathways associated with the stable overexpression of SPRYD7 were visualized. In conclusion, it was demonstrated here that SPRYD7 is a novel protein associated with CRC progression and metastasis. Thus, SPRYD7 and its interactors might be of relevance in identifying novel therapeutic targets for advanced CRC.",

			"abstract": "The Xiphophorus melanoma receptor kinase gene, xmrk, is a bona fide oncogene driving melanocyte tumorigenesis of Xiphophorus fish. When ectopically expressed in medaka, it not only induces development of several pigment cell tumor types in different strains of medaka but also induces different tumor types within the same animal, suggesting its oncogenic activity has a transcriptomic background effect. Although the central pathways that xmrk utilizes to lead to melanomagenesis are well documented, genes and genetic pathways that modulate the oncogenic effect and alter the course of disease have not been studied so far. To understand how the genetic networks between different histocytes of xmrk-driven tumors are composed, we isolated two types of tumors, melanoma and xanthoerythrophoroma, from the same xmrk transgenic medaka individuals, established the transcriptional profiles of both xmrk-driven tumors, and compared (1) genes that are co-expressed with xmrk in both tumor types, and (2) differentially expressed genes and their associated molecular functions, between the two tumor types. Transcriptomic comparisons between the two tumor types show melanoma and xanthoerythrophoroma are characterized by transcriptional features representing varied functions, indicating distinct molecular interactions between the driving oncogene and the cell-type-specific transcriptomes. Melanoma tumors exhibit gene signatures that are relevant to proliferation and invasion, while xanthoerythrophoroma tumors are characterized by expression profiles related to metabolism and DNA repair. We conclude the transcriptomic backgrounds, exemplified by cell-type-specific genes that are downstream of xmrk effected signaling pathways, contribute the potential to change the course of tumor development and may affect overall tumor outcomes.",

The updated EC classification emphasizes the significant role of various signaling pathways such as PIK3CA-PIK3R1-PTEN and RTK/RAS/\u03b2-catenin in EC pathogenesis. Some of these pathways are part of the EGF system signaling network, which becomes hyperactivated by various mechanisms and participates in cancer pathogenesis. In EC, the expression of ErbB receptors is significantly different, compared with the premenopausal and postmenopausal endometrium, mainly because of the increased transcriptional activity of ErbB encoding genes in EC cells. Moreover, there are some differences in ErbB-2 receptor profile among EC subgroups that could be explained by the alterations in pathophysiology and clinical behavior of various EC histologic subtypes. The fact that ErbB-2 receptor expression is more common in aggressive EC histologic subtypes (papillary serous and clear cell) could indicate a future role of ErbB-targeted therapies in well-defined EC subgroups with overexpression of ErbB receptors.",

Here, we report paired-end and complementary consensus sequencing (PECC-Seq), a high-accuracy ecNGS approach for genome-wide somatic mutation detection. We characterize a novel 2-aminoimidazolone lesion besides 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine and the resulting end-repair artifacts originating from NGS library preparation that obscure the sequencing accuracy of NGS. We modify library preparation protocol for the enzymatic removal of end-repair artifacts and improve the accuracy of our previously developed duplex consensus sequencing method. Optimized PECC-Seq shows an error rate of\u00a0<5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-8 with consensus bases compressed from approximately 25 Gb of raw sequencing data, enabling the accurate detection of low-abundance somatic mutations. We apply PECC-Seq to the quantification of in vivo mutagenesis. Compared with the classic gpt gene mutation assay using gpt delta transgenic mice, PECC-Seq exhibits high sensitivity in quantitatively measuring dose-dependent mutagenesis induced by Aristolochic acid I (AAI). Moreover, PECC-Seq specifically characterizes the distinct genome-wide mutational signatures of AAI, Benzo[a]pyrene, N-Nitroso-N-ethylurea and N-nitrosodiethylamine and reveals the mutational signature of Quinoline in common mouse models. Overall, our findings demonstrate that high-accuracy PECC-Seq is a promising tool for genome-wide somatic mutagenesis quantification and for in\u00a0vivo mutagenicity testing.",

DNA mutations, chemical or environmental exposure, viral infections, chronic inflammation, hormone abnormalities, etc., are underlying factors that can cause cancer. Drug resistance and toxicity complicate cancer treatment. Additionally, the variability of cancer makes it difficult to establish universal treatment guidelines. Next-generation sequencing has made genetic testing inexpensive. This uncovers genetic mutations that can be treated with specialty drugs. AI (artificial intelligence), machine learning, biopsy, next-generation sequencing, and digital pathology provide personalized cancer treatment. This allows for patient-specific biological targets and cancer treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, CAR-T, and cancer vaccines are promising cancer treatments. Recent trial data incorporating these therapies have shown superiority in clinical outcomes and drug tolerability over conventional chemotherapies. Combinations of these therapies with new technology can change cancer treatment and help many. This review discusses the development and challenges of targeted therapies like monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), bispecific antibodies (BsAbs), bispecific T cell engagers (BiTEs), dual variable domain (DVD) antibodies, CAR-T therapy, cancer vaccines, oncolytic viruses, lipid nanoparticle-based mRNA cancer vaccines, and their clinical outcomes in various cancers.

			"abstract": "The recent developments in the study of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system have revolutionized the art of genome-editing and its applications for cellular differentiation and immune response behavior. This technology has further helped in understanding the mysteries of cancer progression and possible designing of novel antitumor immunotherapies. CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-editing is now often used to engineer universal T-cells, equipped with recombinant T-cell receptor (TCR) or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). In addition, this technology is used in cytokine stimulation, antibody designing, natural killer (NK) cell transfer, and to overcome immune checkpoints. The innovative potential of CRISPR/Cas9 in preparing the building blocks of adoptive cell transfer (ACT) immunotherapy has opened a new window of antitumor immunotherapy and some of them have gained FDA approval. The manipulation of immunogenetic regulators has opened a new interface for designing, implementation and interpretation of CRISPR/Cas9-based screening in immuno-oncology. Several cancers like lymphoma, melanoma, lung, and liver malignancies have been treated with this strategy, once thought to be impossible. The safe and efficient delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 system within the immune cells for the genome-editing strategy is a challenging task which needs to be sorted out for efficient immunotherapy. Several targeting approaches like virus-mediated, electroporation, microinjection and nanoformulation-based methods have been used, but each procedure offers some limitations. Here, we elaborate the recent updates of cancer management through immunotherapy in partnership with CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Further, some innovative methods of targeting this genome-editing system within the immune system cells for reprogramming them, as a novel strategy of anticancer immunotherapy is elaborated. In addition, future prospects and clinical trials are also discussed.",

			"abstract": "Cancer is a fatal disease and a significant cause of millions of deaths. Traditional methods for cancer detection often have limitations in identifying the disease in its early stages, and they can be expensive and time-consuming. Since cancer typically lacks symptoms and is often only detected at advanced stages, it is crucial to use affordable technologies that can provide quick results at the point of care for early diagnosis. Biosensors that target specific biomarkers associated with different types of cancer offer an alternative diagnostic approach at the point of care. Recent advancements in manufacturing and design technologies have enabled the miniaturization and cost reduction of point-of-care devices, making them practical for diagnosing various cancer diseases. Furthermore, machine learning (ML) algorithms have been employed to analyze sensor data and extract valuable information through the use of statistical techniques. In this review paper, we provide details on how various machine learning algorithms contribute to the ongoing development of advanced data processing techniques for biosensors, which are continually emerging. We also provide information on the various technologies used in point-of-care cancer diagnostic biosensors, along with a comparison of the performance of different ML algorithms and sensing modalities in terms of classification accuracy.",

			"abstract": "Unresolved inflammation is a pathological consequence of persistent inflammatory stimulus and perturbation in regulatory mechanisms. It increases the risk of tumour development and orchestrates all stages of tumorigenesis in selected organs. In certain cancers, inflammatory processes create the appropriate conditions for neoplastic transformation. While in other types, oncogenic changes pave the way for an inflammatory microenvironment that leads to tumour development. Of interest, hallmarks of tumour-promoting and cancer-associated inflammation are striking similar, sharing a complex network of stromal (fibroblasts and vascular cells) and inflammatory immune cells that collectively form the tumour microenvironment (TME). The cross-talks of signalling pathways initially developed to support homeostasis, change their role, and promote atypical proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and subversion of adaptive immunity in TME. These transcriptional and regulatory pathways invariably contribute to cancer-promoting inflammation in chronic inflammatory disorders and foster \"smouldering\" inflammation in the microenvironment of various tumour types. Besides identifying common target sites of numerous cancer types, signalling programs and their cross-talks governing immune cells' plasticity and functional diversity can be used to develop new fate-mapping and lineage-tracing mechanisms. Here, we review the vital molecular mechanisms and pathways that establish the connection between inflammation and tumour development, progression, and metastasis. We also discussed the cross-talks between signalling pathways and devised strategies focusing on these interaction mechanisms to harness synthetic lethal drug combinations for targeted cancer therapy.",

In this study, integrative bioinformatics analyses were performed based on a series of online databases, aiming to identify driver genes with high frequencies of mutations in head and neck cancers. Higher myeloma overexpressed (MYEOV) genetic variation frequency and expression level were connected to a poorer prognosis in head and neck cancer patients. MYEOV was dramatically upregulated within head and neck tumor samples and cells. Consistently, MYEOV overexpression remarkably enhanced the aggressiveness of head and neck cancer cells by promoting colony formation, cell invasion, and cell migration. Conversely, MYEOV knockdown attenuated cancer cell aggressiveness and inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in the oral orthotopic tumor model. In conclusion, MYEOV is overexpressed in head and neck cancer, with greater mutation frequencies correlating to a poorer prognosis in head and neck cancer patients. MYEOV serves as an oncogene in head and neck cancer through the promotion of tumor cell colony formation, invasion, and migration, as well as promoting tumor growth and metastasis in the oral orthotopic tumor model.",

			"abstract": "Palmitic acid (PA) is a saturated fatty acid commonly found in coconut oil and palm oil. It serves as an energy source for the body and plays a role in the structure and function of cell membranes. Beyond its industrial applications, PA has gained attention for its potential therapeutic properties. Modern pharmacological studies have demonstrated that PA exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immune-enhancing effects. In recent years, PA has emerged as a promising anti-tumor agent with demonstrated efficacy against various malignancies including gastric cancer, liver cancer, cervical cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. Its anti-tumor effects encompass inducing apoptosis in tumor cells, inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, suppressing metastasis and invasion, enhancing sensitivity to chemotherapy, and improving immune function. The main anticancer mechanism of palmitic acid (PA) involves the induction of cell apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway, facilitated by the promotion of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. PA also exhibits interference with the cancer cell cycle, leading to cell cycle arrest predominantly in the G1 phase. Moreover, PA induces programmed cell autophagy death, inhibits cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis, and synergistically enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy drugs while reducing adverse reactions. PA acts on various intracellular and extracellular targets, modulating tumor cell signaling pathways, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt), endoplasmic reticulum (ER), B Cell Lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), P53, and other signaling pathways. Furthermore, derivatives of PA play a significant regulatory role in tumor resistance processes. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent studies investigating the anti-tumor effects of PA. It summarizes the underlying mechanisms through which PA exerts its anti-tumor effects, aiming to inspire new perspectives for the treatment of malignant tumors in clinical settings and the development of novel anti-cancer drugs.",

Here, we integrate mutations from 5,120 whole-genome-sequenced tumors from 40 cancer types with 516 topographical features from ENCODE to evaluate the effect of nucleosome occupancy, histone modifications, CTCF binding, replication timing, and transcription/replication strand asymmetries on the cancer-specific accumulation of mutations from distinct mutagenic processes. Most mutational signatures are affected by topographical features, with signatures of related etiologies being similarly affected. Certain signatures exhibit periodic behaviors or cancer-type-specific enrichments/depletions near topographical features, revealing further information about the processes that imprinted them. Our findings, disseminated via the COSMIC (Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer) signatures database, provide a comprehensive online resource for exploring the interactions between mutational signatures and topographical features across human cancer.",

			"abstract": "Comprehensive analysis of multiple data sets can identify potential driver genes for various cancers. In recent years, driver gene discovery based on massive mutation data and gene interaction networks has attracted increasing attention, but there is still a need to explore combining functional and structural information of genes in protein interaction networks to identify driver genes. Therefore, we propose a network embedding framework combining functional and structural information to identify driver genes. Firstly, we combine the mutation data and gene interaction networks to construct mutation integration network using network propagation algorithm. Secondly, the struc2vec model is used for extracting gene features from the mutation integration network, which contains both gene's functional and structural information. Finally, machine learning algorithms are utilized to identify the driver genes. Compared with the previous four excellent methods, our method can find gene pairs that are distant from each other through structural similarities and has better performance in identifying driver genes for 12 cancers in the cancer genome atlas. At the same time, we also conduct a comparative analysis of three gene interaction networks, three gene standard sets, and five machine learning algorithms. Our framework provides a new perspective for feature selection to identify novel driver genes.",

			"abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Due to the lack of early symptoms, GC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage when treatment options are limited. There is an urgent need to identify biomarkers for early detection, prognosis evaluation, and targeted treatment of GC. Studies have shown that Src kinase-associated phosphoprotein 1 (SKAP1) promotes cell proliferation and invasion and is associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and breast cancer. However, the role and mechanism of SKAP1 in GC are unclear. Here, analyses of multiple databases and experiments revealed that SKAP1 expression was higher in GC than in adjacent normal tissues. The Cancer Genome Atlas data showed that high SKAP1 expression was associated with poor GC prognosis. SKAP1 expression was higher in GC than in normal gastric epithelial cells. SKAP1 silencing reduced the proliferation, migration and invasion of the GC cell lines MKN45 and HGC27. Rescue experiments suggest that SKAP1 may promote GC progression by activating JAK1/PI3K/AKT signaling and regulating GC cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and other functions. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that SKAP1 was associated with immune cell infiltration and checkpoint expression in GC. High SKAP1 expression was associated with poorer immunotherapy outcomes, suggesting its potential as a predictive biomarker of GC immunotherapy efficacy. In summary, SKAP1 is overexpressed in GC, where it promotes cell proliferation, invasion and migration and is associated with poor prognosis and poor immunotherapy outcomes. SKAP1 may represent a biomarker and therapeutic target in GC and regulates cellular functions through JAK1/PI3K/AKT signaling.",

Oncogenic potential of SDC2 has been implicated in multiple types of cancers, yet its role and underlying molecular mechanisms in GC remain unknown. Here, we found that SDC2 was highly expressed in GC and its upregulation correlated with poor prognosis in GC patients. Depletion of SDC2 significantly suppressed the growth and invasive capability of GC cells, while overexpressing SDC2 exerts opposite effects. Combined bioinformatics and experimental analyses substantiated that overexpression of SDC2 activated the AKT signaling pathway in GC, mechanistically through the interaction between SDC2 and PDK1-PH domain, thereby facilitating PDK1 membrane translocation to promote AKT activation. Moreover, SDC2 could also function as a co-receptor for FGF2 and was profoundly involved in the FGF2-AKT signaling axis in GC. Lastly, we revealed a mechanism on the USP14-mediated stabilization of SDC2 that is likely to contribute to SDC2 upregulation in GC tissues. Furthermore, we showed that IU1, a potent USP14 inhibitor, decreased the abundance of SDC2 in GC cells. Our findings indicate that SDC2 functions as a novel GC oncogene and has potential utility as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for GC.",

Dysfunction of PIKK members and aberrant stimulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway are linked to a plethora of diseases including cancer. In recent decades, numerous inhibitors related to the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling have made great strides in cancer treatment, like copanlisib and sirolimus. Notably, most of the PIKK inhibitors (such as VX-970 and M3814) related to DNA damage response have also shown good efficacy in clinical trials. However, these drugs still require a suitable combination therapy to overcome drug resistance or improve antitumor activity. Based on the aforementioned facts, we summarised the efficacy of PIKK, PI3K, and AKT inhibitors in the therapy of human malignancies and the resistance mechanisms of targeted therapy, in order to provide deeper insights into cancer treatment.",

Carbohydrate antigens, such as ABO antigens and the \u03b1-gal epitope, differ from protein antigens in that they do not interact with T cells, but B cells interacting with them require T-cell help for their activation. The \u03b1-gal epitope is the core of both A and B antigens and is the ligand of the natural anti-Gal antibody, which is abundant in all humans. In A and O individuals, anti-Gal clones (called anti-Gal/B) comprise >85% of the so-called anti-B activity and bind to the B antigen in facets that do not include fucose-linked \u03b11-2 to the core \u03b1-gal. As many as 1% of B cells are anti-Gal B cells. Activation of quiescent anti-Gal B cells upon exposure to \u03b1-gal epitopes on xenografts and some protozoa can increase the titer of anti-Gal by 100-fold. \u03b11,3-Galactosyltransferase knockout (GT-KO) mice lack \u03b1-gal epitopes and can produce anti-Gal.

Exposure for 2-4\u00a0weeks of na\u00efve and memory mouse anti-Gal B cells to \u03b1-gal epitopes in the heterotopically grafted wild-type (WT) mouse heart results in the elimination of these cells and immune tolerance to this epitope. Shorter exposures of 7\u00a0days of anti-Gal B cells to \u03b1-gal epitopes in the WT heart result in the production of accommodating anti-Gal antibodies that bind to \u03b1-gal epitopes but do not lyse cells or reject the graft.

A chemotherapeutic approach to cancer treatment poses a multitude of challenges, primarily due to the low selectivity and genotoxicity of the majority of chemotherapeutic drugs currently used in the clinical practice, often leading to treatment-induced tumors formation. Highly selective antitumor drugs can largely resolve this issue, but their high selectivity leads to significant drawbacks due to the intrinsic tumor heterogeneity. In contrast, plant polyphenols can simultaneously affect many processes that are involved in the acquiring and maintaining of hallmark properties of malignant cells, and their toxic dose is typically much higher than the therapeutic one. In the present work we describe the mechanisms of the action of polyphenols on cancer cells, including their effects on genetic and epigenetic instability, tumor-promoting inflammation, and altered microbiota.",

We, first, modeled myeloid leukemia in mice by functionally abrogating both Tet2 and Tet3 in HSPCs, followed by transplantation. We, then, performed pooled CRISPR/Cas9 editing of genes encoding epigenetic factors and identified Pbrm1/Baf180, a subunit of the polybromo BRG1/BRM-associated factor SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermenting chromatin-remodeling complex, as a negative driver of disease progression. We found that Pbrm1 loss promoted leukemogenesis with a significantly shortened latency. Pbrm1-deficient leukemia cells were less immunogenic and were characterized by attenuated interferon signaling and reduced major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) expression. We explored the potential relevance to human leukemia by assessing the involvement of PBRM1 in the control of interferon pathway components and found that PBRM1 binds to the promoters of a subset of these genes, most notably IRF1, which in turn regulates MHC II expression. Our findings revealed a novel role for Pbrm1 in leukemia progression.

			"abstract": "Cancers evolve under the accumulation of thousands of somatic mutations and chromosomal aberrations. While most coding mutations are deleterious, almost all protein-coding genes lack detectable signals of negative selection. This raises the question of how tumors tolerate such large amounts of deleterious mutations. Using 8,690 tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we demonstrate that copy number amplifications frequently cover haploinsufficient genes in mutation-prone regions. This could increase tolerance towards the deleterious impact of mutations by creating safe copies of wild-type regions and, hence, protecting the genes therein. Our findings demonstrate that these potential buffering events are highly influenced by gene functions, essentiality, and mutation impact and that they occur early during tumor evolution. We show how cancer type-specific mutation landscapes drive copy number alteration patterns across cancer types. Ultimately, our work paves the way for the detection of novel cancer vulnerabilities by revealing genes that fall within amplifications likely selected during evolution to mitigate the effect of mutations.",

			"abstract": "Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, and the main treatment methods for this condition are surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. These treatment methods are invasive and can cause severe adverse reactions among organisms, so nanomaterials are increasingly used as structures for anticancer therapies. Dendrimers are a type of nanomaterial with unique properties, and their production can be controlled to obtain compounds with the desired characteristics. These polymeric molecules are used in cancer diagnosis and treatment through the targeted distribution of some pharmacological substances. Dendrimers have the ability to fulfill several objectives in anticancer therapy simultaneously, such as targeting tumor cells so that healthy tissue is not affected, controlling the release of anticancer agents in the tumor microenvironment, and combining anticancer strategies based on the administration of anticancer molecules to potentiate their effect through photothermal therapy or photodynamic therapy. The purpose of this review is to summarize and highlight the possible uses of dendrimers regarding the diagnosis and treatment of oncological conditions.",

Metformin, which is widely used to treat type 2 diabetes, inhibits the growth of cancer cells in animal models. Here we investigated the effects of metformin on human gastric cancer cell lines. We also investigated the synergistic anticancer effect of metformin and proton pump inhibitors. Lansoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, is effective for treating gastroesophageal reflux disease. Our results revealed that metformin and lansoprazole can significantly inhibit cancer cell growth in a dose-dependent manner by suppressing cell cycle progression and inducing apoptosis. Low concentrations of metformin and lansoprazole have a synergistic effect on AGS cell growth inhibition. In summary, our findings suggest a new and safe treatment protocol for treating stomach cancers.",

We found that many mutational processes are active mainly or solely in early RT, such as SBS16 in hepatocytes and SBS88 in the colon, or in late RT, such as SBS4 in lung and hepatocytes, and SBS18 across many tissues. The two ubiquitous signatures, SBS1 and SBS5, showed late and early bias, respectively, across multiple tissues and in mutations representing germ cells. We also performed a direct comparison with cancer samples in 4 matched tissue-cancer types. Unexpectedly, while for most signatures the RT bias was consistent in normal tissue and in cancer, we found that SBS1's late RT bias is lost in cancer.",

The characteristics of P18Na- and DOX-loaded nano-transferosomes were assessed, and the pharmacological efficacy of P18Na and DOX was determined using the HeLa and A549 cell lines. The nanodrug delivery system characteristics of the product were found to range from 98.38 to 217.50 nm and -23.63 to -41.10 mV, respectively. Further, the release of P18Na and DOX from nano-transferosomes exhibited a sustained pH-responsive behavior and burst in physiological and acidic environments, respectively. Accordingly, the nano-transferosomes effectively delivered P18Na and DOX into cancer cells, with less leakage in the body, and exhibited pH-responsive release in cancer cells. A photo-cytotoxicity study to HeLa and A549 cell lines revealed a size-dependent anti-cancer effect. These results suggest that the combined nano-transferosomes of P18Na and DOX are effective in the combination of PDT and chemotherapy for cancer.",

These TIME eQTLs are enriched in areas of active transcription, and associate with gene expression in specific immune cell subsets, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. Polygenic score models built with TIME eQTLs reproducibly stratify cancer risk, survival and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) response across independent cohorts. To assess whether an eQTL-informed approach could reveal potential cancer immunotherapy targets, we inhibit CTSS, a gene implicated by cancer risk and ICB response-associated polygenic models; CTSS inhibition results in slowed tumor growth and extended survival in vivo.

These products are often released in biofluids and could be leveraged for clinical diagnosis and patient stratification.

We describe the cooperative and competitive communication between oncogenic cells and neighboring cells, as revealed by our recent zebrafish imaging studies. Newly generated oncogenic cells are actively eliminated by neighboring cells in healthy epithelia, whereas oncogenic cells cooperate with their neighbors to prime tumorigenesis in unhealthy epithelia via additional mutations or inflammation. In addition, we discuss the potential of zebrafish in vivo imaging to determine the initial steps of human tumorigenesis.Key words: zebrafish, imaging, cell-cell communication, cell competition, EDAC, senescence, primary tumorigenesis.",

During the last decade, insights of T cell exhaustion acting as a bottle neck in the field of cancer immunotherapy have undoubtedly provoked attention. One of the main drivers of T cell exhaustion is prolonged antigen presentation, a prerequisite in the cancer-immunity cycle. The umbrella term \"T cell exhaustion\" comprises various stages of T cell functionalities, describing the dynamic, one-way exhaustion process. Together these qualities of T cells at the exhaustion continuum can enable tumor clearance, but if the exhaustion acquired timeframe is exceeded, tumor cells have increased possibilities of escaping immune system surveillance. This could be considered a tipping point where exhausted T cells switch from an asset to a liability. In this review, the contrary role of exhausted T cells is discussed.",

Significant genetic alterations have now been identified in most human cancers. Personalized, or precision, oncology involves molecular profiling of tumors to identify targetable alterations for drug treatments. T-cell responses to antigens, including tumor-associated antigens, are mediated by the interaction between stimulatory and inhibitory signaling molecules, known as immune checkpoints. Targets of inhibitory checkpoints include programmed death 1 (PD-1), its ligand PD-L1, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4). Challenges of checkpoint inhibition therapy include the prevalence and severity of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and the short duration of response. Also, the beneficial effects in patients with hematologic malignancies other than Hodgkin's lymphoma remain limited. Checkpoint inhibitors are now integrated into standard-of-care for patients with several types of cancer. This Editorial aims to highlight the impact and challenges of checkpoint inhibitors in personalized/precision oncology and how molecular technologies may begin to address these challenges.",

Initially, programmed-death ligand-1 was the biomarker utilized to predict the efficacy of ICIs. However, its heterogeneous expression in the tumor microenvironment, which is critical to cancer progression, promoted the exploration of the tumor mutation burden (TMB). Research in various cancers, such as melanoma and lung cancer, has shown an association between high TMB and response to ICIs, increasing its predictive value. However, the TMB has failed to predict ICI response in numerous other cancers. Therefore, future research is needed to analyze the variations between cancer types and establish TMB cutoffs in order to create a more standardized methodology for using the TMB clinically. In this review, we aim to explore current research on the efficacy of the TMB as a biomarker, discuss current approaches to overcoming immunoresistance to ICIs, and highlight new trends in the field such as liquid biopsies, next generation sequencing, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, and personalized tumor vaccines.",

Strand asymmetries, including GC skews and mutational biases, have shaped the nucleotide composition of diverse organisms. The investigation of strand asymmetries often serves as a method to understand underlying biological mechanisms, including protein binding preferences, transcription factor interactions, retrotransposition, DNA damage and repair preferences, transcription-replication collisions, and mutagenesis mechanisms. Research into this subject also enables the identification of functional genomic sites, such as replication origins and transcription start sites. Improvements in our ability to detect and quantify DNA strand asymmetries will provide insights into diverse functionalities of the genome, the contribution of different mutational mechanisms in germline and somatic mutagenesis, and our knowledge of genome instability and evolution, which all have significant clinical implications in human disease, including cancer.

The dysregulation of lncRNA expression has been associated with many diseases, including cancer. Mounting evidence suggests lncRNAs to be involved in cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. Thus, understanding the functional implications of lncRNAs in tumorigenesis can aid in developing novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Rich cancer datasets, documenting genomic and transcriptomic alterations together with advancement in bioinformatics tools, have presented an opportunity to perform pan-cancer analyses across different cancer types. This study is aimed at conducting a pan-cancer analysis of lncRNAs by performing differential expression and functional analyses between tumor and non-neoplastic adjacent samples across eight cancer types. Among dysregulated lncRNAs, seven were shared across all cancer types. We focused on three lncRNAs, found to be consistently dysregulated among tumors. It has been observed that these three lncRNAs of interest are interacting with a wide range of genes across different tissues, yet enriching substantially similar biological processes, found to be implicated in cancer progression and proliferation.",

PARP inhibitors show diverse suppressive effects on PARP family members and PARP-DNA trapping potency. These properties are associated with distinct safety/efficacy profiles. Here, we report the nonclinical characteristics of venadaparib (also known as IDX-1197 or NOV140101), a novel potent PARP inhibitor. The physiochemical properties of venadaparib were analyzed. Furthermore, the efficacy of venadaparib against PARP enzymes, PAR formation, and PARP trapping activities, and growth inhibition of cell lines with BRCA mutations were evaluated. Ex vivo and in vivo models were also established to study pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and toxicity. Venadaparib specifically inhibits PARP-1 and -2 enzymes. Oral administration of venadaparib HCl at doses above 12.5 mg/kg significantly reduced tumor growth in the OV_065 patient-derived xenograft model. Intratumoral PARP inhibition remained at over 90% until 24 hours after dosing. Venadaparib had wider safety margins than olaparib. Notably, venadaparib showed favorable physicochemical properties and superior anticancer effects in homologous recombination-deficient in vitro and in vivo models with improved safety profiles. Our results suggest the possibility of venadaparib as a next-generation PARP inhibitor. On the basis of these findings, phase Ib/IIa studies on the efficacy and safety of venadaparib have been initiated.",

			"abstract": "Many types of human cancers are being treated with small molecule ATP-competitive inhibitors targeting the kinase domain of receptor tyrosine kinases. Despite initial successful remission, long-term treatment almost inevitably leads to the emergence of drug resistance mutations at the gatekeeper residue hindering the access of the inhibitor to a hydrophobic pocket at the back of the ATP-binding cleft. In addition to reducing drug efficacy, gatekeeper mutations elevate the intrinsic activity of the tyrosine kinase domain leading to more aggressive types of cancer. However, the mechanism of gain-of-function by gatekeeper mutations is poorly understood. Here, we characterized fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinases harboring two distinct gatekeeper mutations using kinase activity assays, NMR spectroscopy, bioinformatic analyses, and MD simulations. Our data show that gatekeeper mutations destabilize the autoinhibitory conformation of the DFG motif locally and of the kinase globally, suggesting they impart gain-of-function by facilitating the kinase's ability to populate the active state.",

			"abstract": "Efficient cancer immunotherapy depends on selective targeting of high bioactivity therapeutic agents to the tumours. However, delivering exogenous medication might prove difficult in clinical practice. Here we report a cooperative Nano-CRISPR scaffold (Nano-CD) that utilizes a specific sgRNA, selected from a functional screen for triggering endogenous GDSME expression, while releasing cisplatin to initiate immunologic cell death. Mechanistically, cascade-amplification of the antitumor immune response is prompted by the adjuvantic properties of the lytic intracellular content and enhanced by the heightened GDSME expression, resulting in pyroptosis and the release of tumor associated antigens. Neither of the single components provide efficient tumour control, while tumor growth is efficiently inhibited in primary and recurrent melanomas due to the combinatorial effect of cisplatin and self-supplied GSDME. Moreover, Nano-CD in combination with checkpoint blockade creates durable immune memory and strong systemic anti-tumor immune response, leading to disease relapse prevention, lung metastasis inhibition and increased survival in mouse melanomas. Taken together, our therapeutic approach utilizes CRISPR-technology to enable cell-intrinsic protein expression for immunotherapy, using GDSME as prototypic immune modulator. This nanoplatform thus can be applied to modulate further immunological processes for therapeutic benefit.",

This heterogeneity is also extremely unfavorable for the effective use of molecularly targeted medicine. Against the seemingly comprehensive background of this heterogeneity, we single out two supramolecular characteristics common to all tumors: the clustered nature of tumor interactions with their microenvironment and the formation of biomolecular condensates with tumor-specific distinctive features.

			"abstract": "Recently, extracting inherent biological system information (e.g. cellular networks) from genome-wide expression profiles for developing personalized diagnostic and therapeutic strategies has become increasingly important. However, accurately constructing single-sample networks (SINs) to capture individual characteristics and heterogeneity in disease remains challenging. Here, we propose a sample-specific-weighted correlation network (SWEET) method to model SINs by integrating the genome-wide sample-to-sample correlation (i.e. sample weights) with the differential network between perturbed and aggregate networks. For a group of samples, the genome-wide sample weights can be assessed without prior knowledge of intrinsic subpopulations to address the network edge number bias caused by sample size differences. Compared with the state-of-the-art SIN inference methods, the SWEET SINs in 16 cancers more likely fit the scale-free property, display higher overlap with the human interactomes and perform better in identifying three types of cancer-related genes. Moreover, integrating SWEET SINs with a network proximity measure facilitates characterizing individual features and therapy in diseases, such as somatic mutation, mut-driver and essential genes. Biological experiments further validated two candidate repurposable drugs, albendazole for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and encorafenib for HNSCC. By applying SWEET, we also identified two possible LUAD subtypes that exhibit distinct clinical features and molecular mechanisms. Overall, the SWEET method complements current SIN inference and analysis methods and presents a view of biological systems at the network level to offer numerous clues for further investigation and clinical translation in network medicine and precision medicine.",

The cells from the small spheroids generated only small spheroids (S-pattern), while the cells from the large spheroids generated both small and large spheroids (D-pattern), both of which were tumorigenic. Transition from the S-pattern to the D-pattern occurred by various extrinsic triggers, in which Notch signaling and Musashi-1 played a key role. The S-pattern spheroids were resistant to chemotherapy and transited to the D-pattern upon drug treatment through Notch signaling.

Crypts with SBS2/SBS13 often had immediate crypt neighbors without SBS2/SBS13, suggesting that the underlying cause of SBS2/SBS13 is cell-intrinsic.

Chrysin has several pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and antioxidant properties. This study was performed to evaluate the anti-cancer activities of chrysin in cancer therapy. The present study was conducted by systematic review of studies published up to August 2021. Related studies were identified by searching Web of Science (WoS), PubMed, Science Direct, SID, MagIran, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. The keywords of chrysin, cancer, anti-cancer, and cancer therapy were used for searching. The quality of the studies was assessed by the CONSORT checklist. A total of 21 studies were identified. The results of studies showed that chrysin has an anticancer effect by stimulating apoptosis in a wide range of human cells and rats. Chrysin is also an important factor in inhibiting tumor growth and neoplasticity. Chrysin inhibits the growth and proliferation of cancer cells by inducing cytotoxic effects. Therefore, due to the antitumor effects of chrysin and its safety and non-toxicity towards normal cells, this compound can be considered as an adjuvant along with chemotherapeutic agents in cancer treatment.",

Interestingly, the role of isolated, specific gene polymorphisms, especially of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) type, in thyroid carcinoma is under investigation. SNPs are the most common genetic variations in the genome.

These loci are identified as Common Insertion Sites (CISs), i.e. regions with more transposon insertions than expected by chance. However, the identification of CISs is affected by biases in the insertion behaviour of transposon systems. Here, we introduce Transmicron, a novel method that differs from previous methods by (i) modelling neutral insertion rates based on chromatin accessibility, transcriptional activity\u00a0and sequence context and (ii) estimating oncogenic selection for each genomic region using Poisson regression to model insertion counts while controlling for neutral insertion rates. To assess the benefits of our approach, we generated a dataset applying two different transposon systems under comparable conditions. Benchmarking for enrichment of known cancer genes showed improved performance of Transmicron against state-of-the-art methods. Modelling neutral insertion rates allowed for better control of false positives and stronger agreement of the results between transposon systems. Moreover, using Poisson regression to consider intra-sample and inter-sample information proved beneficial in small and moderately-sized datasets. Transmicron is open-source and freely available. Overall, this study contributes to the understanding of transposon biology and introduces a novel approach to use this knowledge for discovering cancer driver genes.",

Here we describe an ultrafast and accurate detector of somatic structural variations that reduces read-mapping costs by filtering out reads matched to pan-genome k-mer sets. The detector, which we named ETCHING (for efficient detection of chromosomal rearrangements and fusion genes), reduces the number of false positives by leveraging machine-learning classifiers trained with six breakend-related features (clipped-read count, split-reads count, supporting paired-end read count, average mapping quality, depth difference and total length of clipped bases). When benchmarked against six callers on reference cell-free DNA, validated biomarkers of structural variants, matched tumour and normal whole genomes, and tumour-only targeted sequencing datasets, ETCHING was 11-fold faster than the second-fastest structural-variant caller at comparable performance and memory use. The speed and accuracy of ETCHING may aid large-scale genome projects and facilitate practical implementations in precision medicine.",

			"abstract": "Pyrimidine metabolism is a hallmark of cancer and will soon become an essential part of cancer therapy. In the tumor microenvironment, cells reprogram pyrimidine metabolism intrinsically and extracellularly, thereby promoting tumorigenesis. Metabolites in pyrimidine metabolism have a significant impact on promoting cancer advancement and modulating immune system responses. In preclinical studies and practical clinical applications, critical targets in pyrimidine metabolism are acted upon by drugs to exert promising therapeutic effects on tumors. However, the pyrimidine metabolism in breast cancer (BC) is still largely underexplored. In this study, 163 credible pyrimidine metabolism-related genes (PMGs) were retrieved, and their somatic mutations and expression levels were determined. In addition, by using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) databases, 12 PMGs related to the overall survival (OS) were determined using the univariate Cox regression analysis. Subsequently, by performing the LASSO Cox hazards regression analysis in the 12 PMGs in TCGA-BRCA dataset, we developed a prognosis nomogram using eight OS-related PMGs and then verified the same in the METABRIC, GSE96058, GSE20685, GSE42568 and GSE86166 data. Moreover, we validated relationships between the pyrimidine metabolism index (PMI) and the survival probability of patients, essential clinical parameters, including the TNM stage and the PAM50 subtypes. Next, we verified the predictive capability of the optimum model, including the signature, the PAM50 subtype, and age, using ROC analysis and calibration curve, and compared it with other single clinical factors for the predictive power of benefit using decision curve analysis. Finally, we investigated the potential effects of pyrimidine metabolism on immune checkpoints, tumor-infiltrating immune cells, and cytokine levels and determined the potential implications of pyrimidine metabolism in BC immunotherapy. In conclusion, our findings suggest that pyrimidine metabolism has underlying prognostic significance in BC and can facilitate a new management approach for patients with different prognoses and more precise immunotherapy.",

To metastasise, cancer cells must acquire the ability to disseminate systemically and to escape an activated immune response.

We acquired mutation and copy number data from 8332 tumours representing 19 cancer types acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Hartwig Medical Foundation. A total of 827,344 non-synonymous mutations across 8332 tumour samples representing 19 cancer types were timed as early or late relative to copy number alterations, and potential driver events were annotated. We found that metastatic cancers had a significantly higher proportion of clonal mutations and a general enrichment of early mutations in p53 and RTK/KRAS pathways. However, while individual pathways demonstrated a clear time-separated preference for specific events, the relative timing did not vary between primary and metastatic cancers. These results indicate that the selective pressure that drives cancer development does not change dramatically between primary and metastatic cancer on a genomic level, and is mainly focused on alterations that increase proliferation.",

While driver genes may be revealed based on excess mutation recurrence or clustering, there is a need for orthogonal principles. Here, we take advantage of the fact that non-cancer genes, containing only passenger mutations under neutral selection, exhibit a likelihood of mutagenesis in a given tumour determined by the tumour's mutational signature and burden. This relationship can be disrupted by positive selection, leading to a difference in the distribution of mutated cases across a cohort for driver and passenger genes. We apply this principle to detect cancer drivers independently of recurrence in large pan-cancer cohorts, and show that our method (SEISMIC) performs comparably to traditional approaches and can provide resistance to known confounding mutational phenomena. Being based on a different principle, the approach provides a much-needed complement to existing methods for detecting signals of selection.",

Organoid cultures conserve the heterogeneity of the originating epithelium regarding cell types and tumor clonality. Therefore, organoids are considered an invaluable tool to study and genetically dissect various aspects of human cancer biology. In this review, we describe the applications, advantages, and limitations of organoids as human cancer models with the main emphasis on colorectal cancer.",

Dysregulation of the sole enzymes responsible for O-GlcNAc cycling, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), and the associated cellular O-GlcNAc profile is a common feature across nearly every cancer type. Many studies have investigated the effects of aberrant OGT/OGA expression on global O-GlcNAcylation activity in cancer cells. However, recent studies have begun to elucidate the roles of protein-protein interactions (PPIs), potentially through regions outside of the immediate catalytic site of OGT/OGA, that regulate greater protein networks to facilitate substrate-specific modification, protein translocalization, and the assembly of larger biomolecular complexes. Perturbation of OGT/OGA PPI networks makes profound changes in the cell and may directly contribute to cancer malignancies. Herein, we highlight recent studies on the structural features of OGT and OGA, as well as the emerging roles and molecular mechanisms of their aberrant PPIs in rewiring cancer networks. By integrating complementary approaches, the research in this area will aid in the identification of key protein contacts and functional modules derived from OGT/OGA that drive oncogenesis and will illuminate new directions for anti-cancer drug development.",

			"abstract": "Worldwide, oesophageal cancer is the sixth leading cause of deaths related to cancer and represents a major health concern. Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the regions of the world with the highest incidence and mortality rates for oesophageal cancer and most of the cases of oesophageal cancer in this region are oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The development and progression of OSCC is characterized by genomic changes which can be utilized as diagnostic or prognostic markers. These include changes in the expression of various genes involved in signaling pathways that regulate pathways that regulate processes that are related to the hallmarks of cancer, changes in the tumor mutational burden, changes in alternate splicing and changes in the expression of non-coding RNAs such as miRNA. These genomic changes give rise to characteristic profiles of altered proteins, transcriptomes, spliceosomes and genomes which can be used in clinical applications to monitor specific disease related parameters. Some of these profiles are characteristic of more aggressive forms of cancer or are indicative of treatment resistance or tumors that will be difficult to treat or require more specialized specific treatments. In Sub-Saharan region of Africa there is a high incidence of viral infections such as HPV and HIV, which are both risk factors for OSCC. The genomic changes that occur due to these infections can serve as diagnostic markers for OSCC related to viral infection. Clinically this is an important distinction as it influences treatment as well as disease progression and treatment monitoring practices. This underlines the importance of the characterization of the molecular landscape of OSCC in order to provide the best treatment, care, diagnosis and screening options for the management of OSCC.",

However, the accuracy of SNV detection is significantly reduced at read depths below \u00d734 due to the lack of a sufficient number of read pairs to help filter out false positives. Many recent studies have revealed the potential of mutational signature (MS) in detecting true SNV, understanding the mutational processes that lead to the development of human cancers, and analyzing the endogenous and exogenous causes. Here, we present DETexT, an SNV detection method better suited to low read depths, which classifies false positive variants by combining MS with deep learning algorithms to mine correlation information around bases in individual reads without relying on the support of duplicate read pairs. We have validated the effectiveness of DETexT on simulated and real datasets and conducted comparative experiments.

Recombination or replication within the gene base ends in a permanent change in the nucleotide collection in a DNA called mutation and some mutations can lead to cancer. Breast adenocarcinoma starts in secretary cells. Breast adenocarcinoma is the most common of all cancers that occur in women. According to a survey within the United States of America, there are more than 282,000 breast adenocarcinoma patients registered each 12 months, and most of them are women. Recognition of cancer in its early stages saves many lives. A proposed framework is developed for the early detection of breast adenocarcinoma using an ensemble learning technique with multiple deep learning algorithms, specifically: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Bi-directional LSTM. There are 99 types of driver genes involved in breast adenocarcinoma. This study uses a dataset of 4127 samples including men and women taken from more than 12 cohorts of cancer detection institutes. The dataset encompasses a total of 6170 mutations that occur in 99 genes. On these gene sequences, different algorithms are applied for feature extraction. Three types of testing techniques including independent set testing, self-consistency testing, and a 10-fold cross-validation test is applied to validate and test the learning approaches. Subsequently, multiple deep learning approaches such as LSTM, GRU, and bi-directional LSTM algorithms are applied. Several evaluation metrics are enumerated for the validation of results including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Mathew's correlation coefficient, area under the curve, training loss, precision, recall, F1 score, and Cohen's kappa while the values obtained are 99.57, 99.50, 99.63, 0.99, 1.0, 0.2027, 99.57, 99.57, 99.57, and 99.14 respectively.",

During the developmental process, three germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm) are formed during embryonic development that differentiate into organs via the epigenetic regulation of specific genes. To examine the relationship, the specificities of cancer gene mutations that depend on the germ layers are studied. The major organs affected by cancer were determined based on statistics from the National Cancer Information Center of Korea, and were grouped according to their germ layer origins. Then, the gene mutation frequencies were evaluated to identify any bias based on the differentiation group using the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database. The chi-square test showed that the p-value of 152 of 166 genes was less than 0.05, and 151 genes showed p-values of less than 0.05 even after adjusting for the false discovery rate (FDR). The germ layer-specific genes were evaluated using visualization based on basic statistics, and the results matched the top ranking genes depending on organs in the COSMIC database.The current study confirmed the germ layer specificity of major cancer genes. The germ layer specificity of mutated driver genes is possibly important in cancer treatments because each mutated gene may react differently depending on the germ layer of origin. By understanding the mechanism of gene mutation in the development and progression of cancer in the context of cell-fate pathways, a more effective therapeutic strategy for cancer can be established.",

			"abstract": "A variety of cancers have been found to have chromosomal rearrangements, and the genomic abnormalities often induced expression of fusion oncogenes. To date, a pair of engineered nucleases including ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases have been used to generate chromosomal rearrangement in living cells and organisms for disease modeling. However, these methods induce unwanted indel mutations at the DNA break junctions, resulting in incomplete disease modeling. Here, we developed prime editor nuclease-mediated translocation and inversion (PETI), a method for programmable chromosomal translocation and inversion using prime editor 2 nuclease (PE2 nuclease) and paired pegRNA. Using PETI method, we successfully introduced DNA recombination in episomal fluorescence reporters as well as precise chromosomal translocations in human cells. We applied PETI to create cancer-associated translocations and inversions such as NPM1-ALK and EML4-ALK in human cells. Our findings show that PETI generated chromosomal translocation and inversion in a programmable manner with efficiencies comparable of Cas9. PETI methods, we believe, could be used to create disease models or for gene therapy.",

			"abstract": "Prostate cancer (PRAD) is a common and fatal malignancy. It is difficult to manage clinically due to drug resistance and poor prognosis, thus creating an urgent need for novel therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers. Although G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been most attractive for drug development, there have been lack of an exhaustive assessment on GPCRs in PRAD like their molecular features, prognostic and therapeutic values. To close this gap, we herein systematically investigate multi-omics profiling for GPCRs in the primary PRAD by analyzing somatic mutations, somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs), DNA methylation and mRNA expression. GPCRs exhibit low expression levels and mutation frequencies while SCNAs are more prevalent. 46 and 255 disease-related GPCRs are identified by the mRNA expression and DNA methylation analysis, respectively, complementing information lack in the genome analysis. In addition, the genomic alterations do not exhibit an observable correlation with the GPCR expression, reflecting the complex regulatory processes from DNA to RNA. Conversely, a tight association is observed between the DNA methylation and mRNA expression. The virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulation further identify four potential drugs in repositioning to PRAD. The combination of 3 clinical characteristics and 26 GPCR molecular features revealed by the transcriptome and genome exhibit good performance in predicting progression-free survival in patients with the primary PRAD, providing candidates as new biomarkers. These observations from the multi-omics analysis on GPCRs provide new insights into the underlying mechanism of primary PRAD and potential of GPCRs in developing therapeutic strategies on PRAD.",

Recent technological innovations in molecular biology have allowed the study of cancer-resistant mammals, despite the fact that they are not the classical model animals, which are easily studied using genetic approaches. Naked mole-rats (NMRs; Heterocephalus glaber) are the longest-lived rodent, with a maximum lifespan of more than 37\u2009years, and almost never show spontaneous carcinogenesis. NMRs are currently attracting much attention from aging and cancer researchers, and published studies on NMR have continued to increase over the past decade. Cancer development occurs via multiple steps and involves many biological processes. Recent research on the NMR as a model for cancer resistance suggests that they possess various unique carcinogenesis-resistance mechanisms, including efficient DNA repair pathways, cell-autonomous resistance to transformation, and dampened inflammatory response. Here, we summarize the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis resistance in NMR, which have been uncovered over the past two decades, and discuss future perspectives.",

			"abstract": "(1) Background: Chronic myeloid leukemia is defined as the neoplastic development of mostly myeloid cells in the bone marrow. Several treatments, including chemotherapy, radiation, hormone treatment, and immunological therapy, can be used to control this condition. The therapeutic impact on leukemic individuals varies, and the response to therapy varies between patients due to disease heterogeneity. The primary goal of this study is to compare the effects of single and Imatinib (IM) and Hydroxyurea (HU) combined treatment on hematological parameters and gene expression in CML patients. (2) Methods: This study was conducted on 51 patients, with chronic myeloid leukemia, who were admitted to Al-Basher hospital in Amman, Jordan, for follow-up. Their hematological parameters were checked and gene expression was measured for (BCL2, PP2A, CIP2A, and WT1). (3) Results: The BCL2 gene was found to be less expressed in both IM and (HU + IM) treatments as compared to the HU group alone, while PP2A gene expression was raised. Such a thing indicates that the outcome of the combined therapy method is not ideal, since PP2A activation causes CML cells to move toward the blast crisis stage. Furthermore, CIP2A gene expression revealed that IM and (HU + IM) had the same therapeutic effect and were more successful in CML patients than HU alone. With regards to the treatment effect on hematological parameters, notably in CML patients in later stages, the combination therapy (HU + IM) raised lymphocyte count, indicating a greater response to the treatment. When compared to single medicines, the combination treatment reduced the proportion of neutrophils to normal reference ranges. Platelet counts, on the other hand, dramatically decreased in both IM and (HU + IM). (4) Conclusion: Because the studied genes (BCL2, PP2A, CIP2A, and WT1) are participating in cell proliferation and death, the findings show that the examined genes are significant to understand the efficacy of various therapies. Furthermore, it was found that there was a clear effect of the clinic-based strategic treatment on hematological indicators such as WBCs, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and platelet counts.",

			"abstract": "A vast effort has been invested in the identification of driver mutations of cancer. However, recent studies and observations call into question whether the activating mutations or the signal strength are the major determinant of tumor development. The data argue that signal strength determines cell fate, not the mutation that initiated it. In addition to activating mutations, factors that can impact signaling strength include (i) homeostatic mechanisms that can block or enhance the signal, (ii) the types and locations of additional mutations, and (iii) the expression levels of specific isoforms of genes and regulators of proteins in the pathway. Because signal levels are largely decided by chromatin structure, they vary across cell types, states, and time windows. A strong activating mutation can be restricted by low expression, whereas a weaker mutation can be strengthened by high expression. Strong signals can be associated with cell proliferation, but too strong a signal may result in oncogene-induced senescence. Beyond cancer, moderate signal strength in embryonic neural cells may be associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, and moderate signals in aging may be associated with neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's disease. The challenge for improving patient outcomes therefore lies in determining signaling thresholds and predicting signal strength.",

However, tumor heterogeneity is recognized as a serious barrier to annotate cancer genomes at the individual patient level. In addition, the interpretation and analysis of cancer multi-omics data rely heavily on existing database resources that are often located in different data centers or research institutions, which poses a huge challenge for data parsing. Here we present CCAS (Cancer genome Consensus Annotation System, https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/ccas/#/home), a one-stop and comprehensive annotation system for the individual patient at multi-omics level. CCAS integrates 20 widely recognized resources in the field to support data annotation of 10 categories of cancers covering 395 subtypes. Data from each resource are manually curated and standardized by using ontology frameworks. CCAS accepts data on single nucleotide variant/insertion or deletion, expression, copy number variation, and methylation level as input files to build a consensus annotation. Outputs are arranged in the forms of tables or figures and can be searched, sorted, and downloaded. Expanded panels with additional information are used for conciseness, and most figures are interactive to show additional information. Moreover, CCAS offers multidimensional annotation information, including mutation signature pattern, gene set enrichment analysis, pathways and clinical trial related information. These are helpful for intuitively understanding the molecular mechanisms of tumors and discovering key functional genes.",

Since dividing cells release cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragments into the circulation, we hypothesize that plasma cfDNA might reflect mutational signatures.

In this proof of concept study of plasma WGS at 0.3-1.5x coverage from 215 patients and 227 healthy individuals, we show that both pathological and physiological mutational signatures may be identified in plasma. By applying machine learning to mutation profiles, patients with stage I-IV cancer can be distinguished from healthy individuals with an Area Under the Curve of 0.96. Interrogating mutational processes in plasma may enable earlier cancer detection, and might enable the assessment of cancer risk and etiology.",

Our analyses add 40 single and 18 double substitution signatures to the current mutational signature tally.

			"abstract": "DNA damage constantly threatens genome integrity, and DNA repair deficiency is associated with increased cancer risk. An intuitive and widely accepted explanation for this relationship is that unrepaired DNA damage leads to carcinogenesis due to the accumulation of mutations in somatic cells. But DNA repair also plays key roles in the function of immune cells, and immunodeficiency is an important risk factor for many cancers. Thus, it is possible that emerging links between inter-individual variation in DNA repair capacity and cancer risk are driven, at least in part, by variation in immune function, but this idea is underexplored. In this review we present an overview of the current understanding of the links between cancer risk and both inter-individual variation in DNA repair capacity and inter-individual variation in immune function. We discuss factors that play a role in both types of variability, including age, lifestyle, and environmental exposures. In conclusion, we propose a research paradigm that incorporates functional studies of both genome integrity and the immune system to predict cancer risk and lay the groundwork for personalized prevention.",

			"abstract": "In the past, contradictory statements have been made about the age of cancer genes. While phylostratigraphic studies suggest that cancer genes emerged during the transitional period from unicellularians (UC) to early metazoans (EM), life cycle studies suggest that they arose earlier. This controversy could not be resolved. Phylostratigraphic methods use data from somatic tumor gene collections containing or lacking polyploidy genes (PGCC genes) and compare them to genes from evolutionary node taxa. I analyze whether the selected taxa are suitable to resolve the above contradiction or not. Both cancer and amoebae life cycles have a reproductive asexual germline that produces germline stem cells (GSCs) and somatic cell lines that cannot. When the germline loses its reproductive function, the soma-to-germ transition forms a new reproductive germline. The reproductive polyploidy of cancer is homologous to the reproductive polyploidy of unicellular cysts. PGCCs repair DNA defects, reorganize the involved genome architecture and produce new GSCs. The present study refutes the dogma of the early metazoan origin of cancer. Cancer has a unicellular life cycle that was adopted by early metazoans to rescue themselves from evolutionary dead ends. Early metazoans controlled the unicellular life cycle through suppressor and anti-suppressor genes that could suspend or reactivate it. They are the archetypes of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. Cells of mammalians and humans that reach a similar impasse as early metazoans can reactivate the conserved life cycle of unicellularians.",

			"abstract": "Recent advances in bulk sequencing approaches as well as genomic decoding at the single-cell level have revealed surprisingly high somatic mutational burdens in normal tissues, as well as increased our understanding of the landscape of \"field cancerization\", that is, molecular and immune alterations in mutagen-exposed normal-appearing tissues that recapitulated those present in tumors. Charting the somatic mutational landscapes in normal tissues can have strong implications on our understanding of how tumors arise from mutagenized epithelium. Making sense of those mutations to understand the progression along the pathologic continuum of normal epithelia, preneoplasias, up to malignant tissues will help pave way for identification of ideal targets that can guide new strategies for preventing or eliminating cancers at their earliest stages of development. In this review, we will provide a brief history of field cancerization and its implications on understanding early stages of cancer pathogenesis and deviation from the pathologically \"normal\" state. The review will provide an overview of how mutations accumulating in normal tissues can lead to a patchwork of mutated cell clones that compete while maintaining an overall state of functional homeostasis. The review also explores the role of clonal competition in directing the fate of normal tissues and summarizes multiple mechanisms elicited in this phenomenon and which have been linked to cancer development. Finally, we highlight the importance of understanding mutations in normal tissues, as well as clonal competition dynamics (in both the epithelium and the microenvironment) and their significance in exploring new approaches to combatting cancer.",

Clinical cancer sequencing also increasingly aims to detect SVs, leading to a widespread necessity to interpret their biological and clinical relevance. Recently, analyses of large whole-genome sequencing data sets revealed features that impact rates of SVs across the genome in different cancers. A striking feature has been the extent to which, in both their generation and their influence on the selective fitness of cancer cells, SVs are more specific to individual cancer types than other genetic alterations such as single-nucleotide variants. This Perspective discusses how the folding of the 3D genome, and differences in its folding across cell types, affect observed SV rates in different cancer types as well as how SVs can impact cancer cell fitness.",

The rates and types of somatic mutation vary across individuals, but relatively few inherited influences on mutation processes are known. We perform a gene-based rare variant association study with diverse mutational processes, using human cancer genomes from over 11,000 individuals of European ancestry. By combining burden and variance tests, we identify 207 associations involving 15 somatic mutational phenotypes and 42 genes that replicated in an independent data set at a false discovery rate of 1%. We associate rare inherited deleterious variants in genes such as MSH3, EXO1, SETD2, and MTOR with two phenotypically different forms of DNA mismatch repair deficiency, and variants in genes such as EXO1, PAXIP1, RIF1, and WRN with deficiency in homologous recombination repair. In addition, we identify associations with other mutational processes, such as APEX1 with APOBEC-signature mutagenesis. Many of the genes interact with each other and with known mutator genes within cellular sub-networks. Considered collectively, damaging variants in the identified genes are prevalent in the population. We suggest that rare germline variation in diverse genes commonly impacts mutational processes in somatic cells.",

We hypothesized that variations in the number of copies (CNVs) of specific genes may protect some long-living organisms theoretically more susceptible to tumorigenesis from the onset of cancer. Based on the statistical comparison of gene copy numbers within the genomes of both cancer-prone and -resistant species, we identified novel gene targets linked to tumor predisposition, such as CD52, SAT1 and SUMO. Moreover, considering their genome-wide copy number landscape, we discovered that microRNAs (miRNAs) are among the most significant gene families enriched for cancer progression and predisposition. Through bioinformatics analyses, we identified several alterations in miRNAs copy number patterns, involving miR-221, miR-222, miR-21, miR-372, miR-30b, miR-30d and miR-31, among others. Therefore, our analyses provide the first evidence that an altered miRNAs copy number signature can statistically discriminate species more susceptible to cancer from those that are tumor resistant, paving the way for further investigations.",

			"abstract": "BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the two most commonly mutated tumor suppressor genes associated with hereditary breast cancer (BC). Also, mutations in TP53, PIK3CA, PTEN and AKT1 were observed at a high frequency in BC with their mutation spectrum exhibiting a subgroup particularity with enormous clinical significance in the prevention, classification and treatment of cancers. Unfortunately, the mutation spectrum of these genes is still unknown in most Sub-Saharan African population. Therefore, using samples from 133 unselected BC patients, we aimed to assess the contribution of these mutations by direct Sanger sequencing. The analysis revealed pathogenic germline variants on BRCA1 exon 11 (c.3331C\u2009>\u2009T, 0.75%) and BRCA2 exon 11 (c.5635G\u2009>\u2009T, c.6211delA; 1.5%). Five other pathogenic variants were identified in 61 of the 133 subjects (45.86%), with 39.09% for PIK3CA, 12.78% for TP53. Interestingly, a variant in PIK3CA found in high frequency in our population was different from the one usually found in other populations (c.1634A\u2009>\u2009C, 38.34%), and four patients carried mutations linked to Cowen Syndrome 5 c.[1634A\u2009>\u2009C;1658_1659delGTinsC]. A novel variant (c.312G\u2009>\u2009T) was found in TP53 gene at 12.78%. Overall, mutation carriers were found more in Her2 negative and in patients that underwent surgery and chemotherapy. No pathogenic variant was found in PTEN and AKT1. Our population displayed a high frequency of PIK3CA mutations with an unusual distribution and spectrum as well as a relatively low prevalence of BRCA mutations. Our results provided novel data on an unstudied population and may help in prevention, and the establishment of suitable therapeutic approaches for our population.",

We use deep neural networks to map cancer-specific mutation rates genome-wide at kilobase-scale resolution. These estimates are then refined to search for evidence of driver mutations under positive selection throughout the genome by comparing observed to expected mutation counts. We mapped mutation rates for 37 cancer types and applied these maps to identify putative drivers within intronic cryptic splice regions, 5' untranslated regions and infrequently mutated genes. Our high-resolution mutation rate maps, available for web-based exploration, are a resource to enable driver discovery genome-wide.",

			"abstract": "Fewer DNA mutations have been identified in pediatric tumors than in adult tumors, suggesting that alternative tumorigenic mechanisms, including aberrant DNA methylation, may play a prominent role. In one epigenetic process of regulating gene expression, methyl groups are attached at the 5-carbon of the cytosine ring, leading to 5-methylcytosine (5mC). In somatic cells, 5mC occurs mostly in CpG islands, which are often within promoter regions. In Wilms tumors and acute myeloid leukemias, increased levels of epigenetic silencing have been associated with worse patient outcomes. However, to date, researchers have studied methylation primarily in adult tumors and for specific genes-but not on a pan-pediatric cancer scale. We addressed these gaps first by aggregating methylation data from 309 noncancerous samples, establishing baseline expectations for each probe and gene. Even though these samples represent diverse, noncancerous tissue types and population ancestral groups, methylation levels were consistent for most genes. Second, we compared tumor methylation levels against the baseline values for 489 pediatric tumors representing five cancer types: Wilms tumors, clear cell sarcomas of the kidney, rhabdoid tumors, neuroblastomas, and osteosarcomas. Tumor hypomethylation was more common than hypermethylation, and as many as 41.7% of genes were hypomethylated in a given tumor, compared to a maximum of 34.2% for hypermethylated genes. However, in known oncogenes, hypermethylation was more than twice as common as in other genes. We identified 139 probes (31 genes) that were differentially methylated between at least one tumor type and baseline levels, and 32 genes that were differentially methylated across the pediatric tumor types. We evaluated whether genomic events and aberrant methylation were mutually exclusive but did not find evidence of this phenomenon.",

Metastatic progression includes distinct phases: invasion, intravasation, hematogenous dissemination, extravasation and seeding at distant sites, micro-metastasis formation and metastatic outgrowth. Whole-genome sequencing analyses of primary BC and metastases revealed that BC metastatization is a non-genetically selected trait, rather the result of transcriptional and metabolic adaptation to the unfavorable microenvironmental conditions which cancer cells are exposed to (e.g., hypoxia, low nutrients, endoplasmic reticulum stress and chemotherapy administration). In this regard, the latest multi-omics analyses unveiled intra-tumor phenotypic heterogeneity, which determines the polyclonal nature of breast tumors and constitutes a challenge for clinicians, correlating with patient poor prognosis. The present work reviews BC classification and epidemiology, focusing on the impact of metastatic disease on patient prognosis and survival, while describing general principles and current in vitro/in vivo models of the BC metastatic cascade. The authors address here both genetic and phenotypic intrinsic heterogeneity of breast tumors, reporting the latest studies that support the role of the latter in metastatic spreading. Finally, the review illustrates the mechanisms underlying adaptive stress responses during BC metastatic progression.",

As part of multimodal therapy, liver resection is the mainstay of curative-intent treatment for select patients with CRLM. However, effective treatment of CRLM remains challenging as recurrence occurs in most patients after liver resection. Proposed clinicopathologic factors for predicting recurrence are inconsistent and lose prognostic significance over time. The rapid development of next-generation sequencing technologies and decreasing DNA sequencing costs have accelerated the genomic profiling of various cancers. The characterisation of genomic alterations in CRC has significantly improved our understanding of its carcinogenesis. However, the functional context at the protein level has not been established for most of this genomic information. Furthermore, genomic alterations do not always result in predicted changes in the corresponding proteins and cancer phenotype, while post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation may alter synthesised protein levels, affecting phenotypes. More recent advancements in mass spectrometry-based technology enable accurate protein quantitation and comprehensive proteomic profiling of cancers. Several studies have explored proteomic biomarkers for predicting CRLM after oncologic resection of primary CRC and recurrence after curative-intent resection of CRLM. The current review aims to rationalise the proteomic complexity of CRC and explore the potential applications of proteomic biomarkers in CRLM.",

We identify 12 significantly mutated genes and 5 focal CNA regions, and demonstrate common mutations in post-transcriptional modification-related potential driver genes METTL14 and RBM10 in pCCA tumours. Finally we demonstrate the tumour-suppressive role of METTL14, a major RNA N6-adenosine methyltransferase (m6A), and illustrate that its loss-of-function mutation R298H may act through m6A modification on potential driver gene MACF1. Our results may be valuable for better understanding of how post-transcriptional modification can affect CCA development, and highlight both similarities and differences between pCCA and iCCA.",

			"abstract": "Cancer is a complex disease caused by genomic and epigenetic alterations; hence, identifying meaningful cancer drivers is an important and challenging task. Most studies have detected cancer drivers with mutated traits, while few studies consider multiple omics characteristics as important factors. In this study, we present a framework to analyze the effects of multi-omics characteristics on the identification of driver genes. We utilize four machine learning algorithms within this framework to detect cancer driver genes in pan-cancer data, including 75 characteristics among 19,636 genes. The 75 features are divided into four types and analyzed using Kullback-Leibler divergence based on CGC genes and non-CGC genes. We detect cancer driver genes in two different ways. One is to detect driver genes from a single feature type, while the other is from the top N features. The first analysis denotes that the mutational features are the best characteristics. The second analysis reveals that the top 45 features are the most effective feature combinations and superior to the mutational features. The top 45 features not only contain mutational features but also three other types of features. Therefore, our study extends the detection of cancer driver genes and provides a more comprehensive understanding of cancer mechanisms.",

			"abstract": "The rate of adaptive evolution depends on the rate at which beneficial mutations are introduced into a population and the fitness effects of those mutations. The rate of beneficial mutations and their expected fitness effects is often difficult to empirically quantify. As these 2 parameters determine the pace of evolutionary change in a population, the dynamics of adaptive evolution may enable inference of their values. Copy number variants (CNVs) are a pervasive source of heritable variation that can facilitate rapid adaptive evolution. Previously, we developed a locus-specific fluorescent CNV reporter to quantify CNV dynamics in evolving populations maintained in nutrient-limiting conditions using chemostats. Here, we use CNV adaptation dynamics to estimate the rate at which beneficial CNVs are introduced through de novo mutation and their fitness effects using simulation-based likelihood-free inference approaches. We tested the suitability of 2 evolutionary models: a standard Wright-Fisher model and a chemostat model. We evaluated 2 likelihood-free inference algorithms: the well-established Approximate Bayesian Computation with Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) algorithm, and the recently developed Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) algorithm, which applies an artificial neural network to directly estimate the posterior distribution. By systematically evaluating the suitability of different inference methods and models, we show that NPE has several advantages over ABC-SMC and that a Wright-Fisher evolutionary model suffices in most cases. Using our validated inference framework, we estimate the CNV formation rate at the GAP1 locus in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to be 10-4.7 to 10-4 CNVs per cell division and a fitness coefficient of 0.04 to 0.1 per generation for GAP1 CNVs in glutamine-limited chemostats. We experimentally validated our inference-based estimates using 2 distinct experimental methods-barcode lineage tracking and pairwise fitness assays-which provide independent confirmation of the accuracy of our approach. Our results are consistent with a beneficial CNV supply rate that is 10-fold greater than the estimated rates of beneficial single-nucleotide mutations, explaining the outsized importance of CNVs in rapid adaptive evolution. More generally, our study demonstrates the utility of novel neural network-based likelihood-free inference methods for inferring the rates and effects of evolutionary processes from empirical data with possible applications ranging from tumor to viral evolution.",

Various cohort-based computational tools exist to identify driver genes but require multiple samples to identify less frequently mutated driver genes. Many studies use different methods to identify driver mutations/genes from mutations that have no impact on tumor progression; however, a small fraction of patients show no mutational events in any known driver genes. Current unsupervised methods map somatic and expression data onto a network to identify personalized driver genes based on changes in expression. Our method is the first machine learning model to classify genes as tumor suppressor gene (TSG), oncogene (OG), or neutral, thus assigning the functional impact of the gene in the patient. In this study, we develop a multi-omic approach, PIVOT (Personalized Identification of driVer OGs and TSGs), to train on experimentally or computationally validated mutational and structural driver events. Given the lack of any gold standards for the identification of personalized driver genes, we label the data using four strategies and, based on classification metrics, show gene-based labeling strategies perform best. We build different models using SNV, RNA, and multi-omic features to be used based on the data available.

Double mutations T790M/L858R lead to different degrees of drug resistance toward inhibitors. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations followed by principal component analysis are performed to study the conformational changes of EGFR induced by T790M/L858R. The results suggest that T790M/L858R cause obvious disturbance of the structural stability of EGFR. Molecular mechanics-Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) and residue-based free energy decomposition methods are integrated to explore the drug-resistant mechanism of T790M/L858R toward inhibitors. The results show that the decrease in van der Waals interactions of inhibitors with the mutated EFGR relative to the wild-type (WT) one is the main force inducing drug resistance of T790M/L858R toward inhibitors TAK-285, while drug resistance toward W2P and HKI-272 is dominated by the decrease in van der Waals interactions and the increase in polar interactions. We expect that the information obtained from this study can aid rational design of effective drugs to relieve drug resistance of EGFR induced by T790M/L858R.",

Circulating DNA of 71 Egyptian BC patients was isolated, amplified for PIK3CA Exon 20, and sequenced. Mutational signature was determined according to COSMIC v2 signature. Public BC dataset was analysed to assess PIK3CA mutations effect on the transcriptomic profile. Somatic mutations of PIK3CA exon 20 were found in 66.2% of the study cohort. Nucleotide substitution patterns were similar to general nucleotide substitution patterns in BC. Signature 3 and 9 were the most common signatures in the studied BC patients. Signature of Aristolochic acid exposure was found in some cases. The most common nucleotide substitution was T\u00a0>\u00a0A transversion, but substitutions T\u00a0>\u00a0G and T\u00a0>\u00a0C were correlated to each other and to the total mutation number. PIK3CA mutations were found to disrupt several pathways including RAC1, PDGF, Wnt, and integrin signalling. PIK3CA exon 20 mutational signatures in Egyptian BC patients could suggest a disease etiology involving homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and polymerase eta (Pol \u03b7).

Despite many mutational signatures being identified, mutational processes underlying a number of mutational signatures remain unknown, which hinders the identification of interventions that may reduce somatic mutation burdens and prevent the development of cancer. We demonstrate that the unknown cause of a mutational signature can be inferred by the associated signatures with known etiology. However, existing association tests are not statistically powerful due to excess zeros in mutational signatures data. To address this limitation, we propose a semiparametric kernel independence test (SKIT). The SKIT statistic is defined as the integrated squared distance between mixed probability distributions and is decomposed into four disjoint components to pinpoint the source of dependency.

In this study, we evaluated the functional effects of 29,060 cancer-related transition mutations that result in protein variants on the survival and proliferation of non-tumorigenic lung cells using cytosine and adenine base editors and single guide RNA (sgRNA) libraries. By monitoring base editing efficiencies and outcomes using surrogate target sequences paired with sgRNA-encoding sequences on the lentiviral delivery construct, we identified sgRNAs that induced a single primary protein variant per sgRNA, enabling linking those mutations to the cellular phenotypes caused by base editing. The functions of the vast majority of the protein variants (28,458 variants, 98%) were classified as neutral or likely neutral; only 18 (0.06%) and 157 (0.5%) variants caused outgrowing and likely outgrowing phenotypes, respectively. We expect that our approach can be extended to more variants of unknown significance and other tumor types.",

In order to clarify how triptolide may be effective against CRC, we analyzed the proteome and phosphoproteome of CRC cell line HCT116 after incubation for 48 h with the drug (40 nM) or vehicle. Tandem mass tagging led to the identification of 403 proteins whose levels increased and 559 whose levels decreased in the presence of triptolide. We also identified 3,110 sites in proteins that were phosphorylated at higher levels and 3,161 sites phosphorylated at lower levels in the presence of the drug. Analysis of these differentially expressed and/or phosphorylated proteins showed that they were enriched in pathways involving ribosome biogenesis, PI3K-Akt signaling, MAPK signaling, nucleic acid binding as well as other pathways. Protein-protein interactions were explored using the STRING database, and we identified nine protein modules and 15 hub proteins. Finally, we identified 57 motifs using motif analysis of phosphosites and found 16 motifs were experimentally verified for known protein kinases, while 41 appear to be novel. These findings may help clarify how triptolide works against CRC and may guide the development of novel treatments.",

To extend the complexity in cancer, there are substantial differences from cell to cell within an individual tumour (intra-tumour heterogeneity, ITH) and the features of cancer cells evolve in space and time. Currently, treatment-decision making usually relies on the molecular characteristics of a limited tumour tissue sample at the time of diagnosis or disease progression but does not take into account the complexity of the bulk tumours and their constant evolution over time. In this review, we explore the extent of tumour heterogeneity with an emphasis on ITH and report the mechanisms that promote and sustain this diversity in cancers.

Application of suspension culture increased organoid scalability, and a refinement of the culture condition enabled incorporation of normal and precursor organoids to high-throughput drug screening. Drug screening identified bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) bromodomain protein inhibitor as a cancer-selective growth suppressor that targets genes aberrantly activated in CRC. A multi-omics analysis identified an association between checkpoint with forkhead and ring finger domaines (CHFR) silencing and paclitaxel sensitivity, which was further validated by gene engineering of organoids and in xenografts.

In cancer, CNVs are mostly somatic aberrations that occur during cancer evolution. Advances in sequencing technologies and arrival of next-generation sequencing data (whole-genome sequencing and whole-exome sequencing or targeted sequencing) have opened up an opportunity to detect CNVs with higher accuracy and resolution. Many computational methods have been developed for somatic CNV detection, which is a challenging task due to complexity of cancer sequencing data, high level of noise and biases in the sequencing process, and big data nature of sequencing data. Nevertheless, computational detection of CNV in sequencing data has resulted in the discovery of actionable cancer-specific CNVs to be used to guide cancer therapeutics, contributing to significant progress in precision oncology. In this chapter, we start by introducing CNVs. Then, we discuss the main approaches and methods developed for detecting somatic CNV for next-generation sequencing data, along with its challenges. Finally, we describe the overall workflow for CNV detection and introduce the most common publicly available software tools developed for somatic CNV detection and analysis.",

For immune detection, neoantigens must first be presented on class I or II human leukocyte antigens (HLA) followed by recognition by peptide-specific receptors, exemplified by the T-cell receptor (TCR). Detection of neoantigens represents a unique challenge to the immune system due to their high similarity with endogenous 'self' proteins. Here, we review insights into how TCRs detect neoantigens from structural studies and delineate two broad mechanistic categories: 1) recognition of mutated 'self' peptides and 2) recognition of novel 'non-self' peptides generated through anchor residue modifications. While mutated 'self' peptides differ only by a single amino acid from an existing 'self' epitope, mutations that form anchor residues generate an entirely new epitope, hitherto unknown to the immune system. We review recent structural studies that highlight these structurally distinct mechanisms and discuss how they may lead to differential anti-tumor immune responses. We discuss how T cells specific for neoantigens derived from anchor mutations can be of high affinity and provide insights to their use in adoptive T cell transfer-based immunotherapy.",

Polymeric nanostructures have emerged as competent vehicles for protein delivery, as they are multifunctional and can be tailored according to their peculiarities. Thus, the enhanced bioavailability and biocompatibility, the adjustable control of physicochemical features, and the colloidal stability of polymer-based nanostructures further enable either the embedding or conjugation of hydrophobic or hydrophilic bioactive molecules, which are some of the features of paramount importance that they possess and which contribute to their selection as vehicles.

To elucidate the timing and mechanism of the clonal expansion of somatic mutations in cancer-associated genes in the normal endometrium, we sequence 1311 endometrial glands from 37 women. By collecting endometrial glands from different parts of the endometrium, we show that multiple glands with the same somatic mutations occupy substantial areas of the endometrium. We demonstrate that \"rhizome structures\", in which the basal glands run horizontally along the muscular layer and multiple vertical glands rise from the basal gland, originate from the same ancestral clone. Moreover, mutant clones detected in the vertical glands diversify by acquiring additional mutations. These results suggest that clonal expansions through the rhizome structures are involved in the mechanism by which mutant clones extend their territories. Furthermore, we show clonal expansions and copy neutral loss-of-heterozygosity events occur early in life, suggesting such events can be tolerated many years in the normal endometrium. Our results of the evolutionary dynamics of mutant clones in the human endometrium will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of endometrial regeneration during the menstrual cycle and the development of therapies for the prevention and treatment of endometrium-related diseases.",

One of the main hallmarks in cancer is the functional deregulation of crucial molecular pathways via driver genetic events that lead to abnormal gene expression, giving cells a selective growth advantage. Driver events are defined as mutations, fusions and copy number alterations that are causally implicated in oncogenesis. Molecular analysis on tissues that have originated from a wide range of anatomical areas has shown that mutations in different members of several pathways are implicated in different cancer types. In recent decades, significant efforts have been made to incorporate this knowledge into daily medical practice, providing substantial insight towards clinical diagnosis and personalized therapies. However, since there is still a strong need for more effective drug development, a deep understanding of the involved signaling mechanisms and the interconnections between these pathways is highly anticipated. Here, we perform a systemic analysis on cancer patients included in the Pan-Cancer Atlas project, with the aim to select the ten most highly mutated signaling pathways (p53, RTK-RAS, lipids metabolism, PI-3-Kinase/Akt, ubiquitination, b-catenin/Wnt, Notch, cell cycle, homology directed repair (HDR) and splicing) and to provide a detailed description of each pathway, along with the corresponding therapeutic applications currently being developed or applied. The ultimate scope is to review the current knowledge on highly mutated pathways and to address the attractive perspectives arising from ongoing experimental studies for the clinical implementation of personalized medicine.",

These issues have often been individually reviewed, but there is a growing body of evidence for the interconnection of both causes of cancer. Actually, aberrant splicing may result from abnormal epigenetic signalization and epigenetic factors may be altered by alternative splicing. In this way, the interrelation between epigenetic marks and alternative splicing form the base of a triangle, while cancer may be placed at the vertex. The present review centers on the interconnections at the triangle base, i.e., between alternative splicing and epigenetic modifications, which may result in neoplastic transformations. The effects of different epigenetic factors, including DNA and histone modifications, the binding of non-coding RNAs and the alterations of chromatin organization on alternative splicing resulting in cancer are first considered. Other less-frequently considered questions, such as the epigenetic regulation of the splicing machinery, the aberrant splicing of epigenetic writers, readers and erasers, etc., are next reviewed in their connection with cancer. The knowledge of the above-mentioned relationships has allowed increasing the collection of biomarkers potentially useful as cancer diagnostic and/or prognostic tools. Finally, taking into account on one hand that epigenetic changes are reversible, and some epigenetic drugs already exist and, on the other hand, that drugs intended for reversing aberrations in alternative splicing, therapeutic possibilities for breaking the mentioned cancer-related triangle are discussed.",

Over the past decades, the concept of precision cancer medicine has emerged as a novel approach in the field of oncology that aims to tailor the most effective treatment options to each individual cancer patient based on the genetic profile of the tumor of each individual patient. Recently, tissue biopsy has become an essential part of cancer care and is widely used to characterize the tumor. However, tissue biopsy techniques face different challenges due to their invasiveness, cost, time, and adversity in potential sampling due to tissue heterogeneity. To overcome these issues, a non-invasive approach has developed, which is known as liquid biopsy. It is a simple, fast, and worthwhile technique based on the analysis of circulating tumor DNA (which is a fraction of cfDNA), circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and other tumor-derived material in blood plasma. This review provides an overview of the concept of liquid biopsy and briefly discusses the role of ctDNA and CTC analysis as tools for early diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. In this review, we also speculate on the advantages of liquid biopsy as opposed to tissue biopsy and postulate that liquid biopsy may be a comprehensive approach to overcome the current limitations associated with costly, invasive, and time-consuming tissue biopsy.",

Here, our integrated copy number and transcriptome analysis of 302 TNBC patients reveals that gene alpha-endosulfine (ENSA) exhibits recurrent amplification at the 1q21.3 region and is highly expressed in TNBC. ENSA promotes tumor growth and indicates poor patient survival in TNBC. Mechanistically, we identify ENSA as an essential regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis in TNBC that upregulates the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 2 (SREBP2), a pivotal transcription factor in cholesterol biosynthesis. We confirm that ENSA can increase the level of p-STAT3 (Tyr705) and activated STAT3 binds to the promoter of SREBP2 to promote its transcription. Furthermore, we reveal the efficacy of STAT3 inhibitor Stattic in TNBC with high ENSA expression. In conclusion, the amplification of ENSA at the 1q21.3 region promotes TNBC progression and indicates sensitivity to STAT3 inhibitors.",

However, while some patients benefit from ICI, others do not. In fact, predictive biomarkers can play a crucial role in screening patients who may benefit from a selected or targeted treatment, including immunotherapies such as programmed death-1/programmed death-1 ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitors. A variety of techniques can be used to detect and quantify tumor biomarkers, each of which has a specific clinical application scenario and limitations. Cancer biomarkers in the gastrointestinal system involve an extremely complex network that requires careful interpretation and analysis. Different prognostic or predictive biomarkers are playing important roles in various tumor types, stages, and pathology/molecular subgroups, sometimes overlapping. Expression levels of biomarkers vary between different tumor types and even between the different lesions in the same tumor, depending on the heterogeneity of the patient, the tumor types, and the techniques of detection. The present systematic review comprehensively summarizes the potential biomarkers of immunotherapy, such as PD-1/PD-L1, total mutation burden (TMB), and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in various gastrointestinal tumors, including tumors of the colon, stomach, esophagus, liver, and pancreas, to assist future application of immunotherapy and patient selection in clinical practice.",

Blocking the energy and material supply of tumor cells is one of the strategies to treat tumor, however tumor cell metabolic heterogeneity prevents metabolic-based anti-cancer treatment. Therefore, searching for the key metabolic factors that regulate cell cancerous change and tumor recurrence has become a major challenge. Emerging technology--single-cell metabolomics is different from the traditional metabolomics that obtains average information of a group of cells. Single-cell metabolomics identifies the metabolites of single cells in different states by mass spectrometry, and captures the molecular biological information of the energy and substances synthesized in single cells, which provides more detailed information for tumor treatment metabolic target screening. This review will combine the current research status of tumor cell metabolism with the advantages of single-cell metabolomics technology, and explore the role of single-cell sequencing technology in searching key factors regulating tumor metabolism. The addition of single-cell technology will accelerate the development of metabolism-based anti-cancer strategies, which may greatly improve the prognostic survival rate of cancer patients.",

The purpose of this study was to analyze EEC exome mutation data to identify late-stage-specific statistically significantly mutated genes (SMGs), which represent candidate driver genes potentially associated with disease progression. We exome sequenced 15 late-stage (stage III or IV) non-ultramutated EECs and paired non-tumor DNAs; somatic variants were called using Strelka, Shimmer, SomaticSniper and MuTect. Additionally, somatic mutation calls were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data for 66 late-stage and 270 early-stage (stage I or II) non-ultramutated EECs. MutSigCV (v1.4) was used to annotate SMGs in the two late-stage cohorts and to derive p-values for all mutated genes in the early-stage cohort. To test whether late-stage SMGs are statistically significantly mutated in early-stage tumors, q-values for late-stage SMGs were re-calculated from the MutSigCV (v1.4) early-stage p-values, adjusting for the number of late-stage SMGs tested. We identified 14 SMGs in the combined late-stage EEC cohorts. When the 14 late-stage SMGs were examined in the TCGA early-stage data, only Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 3 (KLF3) and Paired box 6 (PAX6) failed to reach significance as early-stage SMGs, despite the inclusion of enough early-stage cases to ensure adequate statistical power. Within TCGA, nonsynonymous mutations in KLF3 and PAX6 were, respectively, exclusive or nearly exclusive to the microsatellite instability (MSI)-hypermutated molecular subgroup and were dominated by insertions-deletions at homopolymer tracts. In conclusion, our findings are hypothesis-generating and suggest that KLF3 and PAX6, which encode transcription factors, are MSI target genes and late-stage-specific SMGs in EEC.",

Various computational methods based on mutational frequency, network and function approaches have been developed to identify mutation driver genes in cancer genomes. However, a comprehensive evaluation of the performance levels of network-, function- and frequency-based methods is lacking. In the present study, we assessed and compared eight performance criteria for eight network-based, one function-based and three frequency-based algorithms using eight benchmark datasets. Under different conditions, the performance of approaches varied in terms of network, measurement and sample size. The frequency-based driverMAPS and network-based HotNet2 methods showed the best overall performance. Network-based algorithms using protein-protein interaction networks outperformed the function- and the frequency-based approaches. Precision, F1 score and Matthews correlation coefficient were low for most approaches. Thus, most of these algorithms require stringent cutoffs to correctly distinguish driver and non-driver genes. We constructed a website named Cancer Driver Catalog (http://159.226.67.237/sun/cancer_driver/), wherein we integrated the gene scores predicted by the foregoing software programs. This resource provides valuable guidance for cancer researchers and clinical oncologists prioritizing cancer driver gene candidates by using an optimal tool.",

While several driver genes have been discovered, many remain undiscovered, especially those mutated at a low frequency across samples. This study defines new features and builds a pan-cancer model, cTaG, to identify new driver genes. The features capture the functional impact of the mutations as well as their recurrence across samples, which helps build a model unbiased to genes with low frequency. The model classifies genes into the functional categories of driver genes, tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) and oncogenes (OGs), having distinct mutation type profiles. We overcome overfitting and show that certain mutation types, such as nonsense mutations, are more important for classification. Further, cTaG was employed to identify tissue-specific driver genes. Some known cancer driver genes predicted by cTaG as TSGs with high probability are ARID1A, TP53, and RB1. In addition to these known genes, potential driver genes predicted are CD36, ZNF750 and ARHGAP35 as TSGs and TAB3 as an oncogene. Overall, our approach surmounts the issue of low recall and bias towards genes with high mutation rates and predicts potential new driver genes for further experimental screening. cTaG is available at https://github.com/RamanLab/cTaG .",

In particular, the approval of the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab plus the antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab as front-line treatment for advanced HCC has led to the adoption of this combination in this setting, and the IMbrave 150 phase III trial has established a novel standard of care.

Yet, the molecular bases underlying such features are poorly understood. Here, we leveraged an integrated approach to investigate multiple sources of molecular variation across primates, focusing on over 10,000 genes, including approximately 1,500 previously associated with lifespan, and additional approximately 9,000 for which an association with longevity has never been suggested. We analyzed dN/dS rates, positive selection, gene expression (RNA-seq), and gene regulation (ChIP-seq). By analyzing the correlation between dN/dS, maximum lifespan, and body mass, we identified 276 genes whose rate of evolution positively correlates with maximum lifespan in primates. Further, we identified five genes, important for tumor suppression, adaptive immunity, metastasis, and inflammation, under positive selection exclusively in the great ape lineage. RNA-seq data, generated from the liver of six species representing all the primate lineages, revealed that 8% of approximately 1,500 genes previously associated with longevity are differentially expressed in apes relative to other primates. Importantly, by integrating RNA-seq with ChIP-seq for H3K27ac (which marks active enhancers), we show that the differentially expressed longevity genes are significantly more likely than expected to be located near a novel \"ape-specific\" enhancer. Moreover, these particular ape-specific enhancers are enriched for young transposable elements, and specifically SINE-Vntr-Alus. In summary, we demonstrate that multiple evolutionary forces have contributed to the evolution of lifespan and body size in primates.",

These epimutations, with an impact on chromatin accessibility and transcriptional output, are often associated with genomic instability and the emergence of drug resistance, disease progression, and poor survival. In order to exert their functions, epigenetic enzymes utilize cellular metabolites as co-factors and are highly dependent on their availability. By affecting the expression of metabolic enzymes, epigenetic modifiers may aid the generation of metabolite signatures that could be utilized as targets and biomarkers in cancer. This interdependency remains often neglected and poorly represented in studies, despite well-established methods to study the cellular metabolome. This review critically summarizes the current knowledge in the field to provide an integral picture of the interplay between epigenomic alterations and the cellular metabolome in haematological malignancies. Our recent findings defining a distinct metabolic signature upon response to enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) inhibition in multiple myeloma (MM) highlight how a shift of preferred metabolic pathways may potentiate novel treatments. The suggested link between the epigenome and the metabolome in haematopoietic tumours holds promise for the use of metabolic signatures as possible biomarkers of response to treatment.",

Hotspots reside in network hub proteins and are enriched on protein interaction interfaces, suggesting that alteration of specific protein-protein interactions is critical for the oncogenicity of many hotspot mutations. Our framework enables, for the first time, systematic identification of specific protein interactions affected by hotspot mutations at the full proteome scale. Furthermore, by constructing a hotspot-affected network that connects all hotspot-affected interactions throughout the whole-human interactome, we uncover genome-wide relationships among hotspots and implicate novel cancer proteins that do not harbor hotspot mutations themselves. Moreover, applying our network-based framework to specific cancer types identifies clinically significant hotspots that can be used for prognosis and therapy targets. Overall, we show that our framework bridges the gap between the statistical significance of mutational hotspots and their biological and clinical significance in human cancers.",

			"abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of human proteins. They have a common structure and, signaling through a much smaller set of G proteins, arrestins, and effectors, activate downstream pathways that often modulate hallmark mechanisms of cancer. Because there are many more GPCRs than effectors, mutations in different receptors could perturb signaling similarly so as to favor a tumor. We hypothesized that somatic mutations in tumor samples may not be enriched within a single gene but rather that cognate mutations with similar effects on GPCR function are distributed across many receptors. To test this possibility, we systematically aggregated somatic cancer mutations across class A GPCRs and found a nonrandom distribution of positions with variant amino acid residues. Individual cancer types were enriched for highly impactful, recurrent mutations at selected cognate positions of known functional motifs. We also discovered that no single receptor drives this pattern, but rather multiple receptors contain amino acid substitutions at a few cognate positions. Phenotypic characterization suggests these mutations induce perturbation of G protein activation and/or \u03b2-arrestin recruitment. These data suggest that recurrent impactful oncogenic mutations perturb different GPCRs to subvert signaling and promote tumor growth or survival. The possibility that multiple different GPCRs could moonlight as drivers or enablers of a given cancer through mutations located at cognate positions across GPCR paralogs opens a window into cancer mechanisms and potential approaches to therapeutics.",

This work proposes Discovering Significant Cancer Genes (DiSCaGe), a computational method for discovering significant genes for cancer. DiSCaGe computes a mutation score for the genes based on the type of mutations they have. The influence received for their neighbors in the network is also considered and obtained through an asymmetric spreading strength applied to a consensus gene network.

			"abstract": "The notion that invasive cancer is a product of somatic evolution is a well-established theory that can be modelled mathematically and demonstrated empirically from therapeutic responses. Somatic evolution is by no means deterministic, and ample opportunities exist to steer its trajectory towards cancer cell extinction. One such strategy is to alter the chemical microenvironment shared between host and cancer cells in a way that no longer favours the latter. Ever since the first description of the Warburg effect, acidosis has been recognised as a key chemical signature of the tumour microenvironment. Recent findings have suggested that responses to acidosis, arising through a process of selection and adaptation, give cancer cells a competitive advantage over the host. A surge of research efforts has attempted to understand the basis of this advantage and seek ways of exploiting it therapeutically. Here, we review key findings and place these in the context of a mathematical framework. Looking ahead, we highlight areas relating to cellular adaptation, selection, and heterogeneity that merit more research efforts in order to close in on the goal of exploiting tumour acidity in future therapies.",

A considerable amount of progress has been made in this field with the established 'hallmarks of aging' and continued efforts to investigate the age-related changes observed within the BM. Inflammaging is considered as a low-grade state of inflammation associated with aging, and whilst the possible mechanisms by which aging occurs are now largely understood, the processes leading to the underlying changes within aged BM remain elusive. The ability to identify these changes and detect such alterations at the genetic level are key to broadening the knowledgebase of aging BM. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an important molecular-level application presenting the ability to not only determine genomic base changes but provide transcriptional profiling (RNA-seq), as well as a high-throughput analysis of DNA-protein interactions (ChIP-seq). Utilising NGS to explore the genetic alterations occurring over the aging process within alterative cell types facilitates the comprehension of the molecular and cellular changes influencing the dynamics of aging BM. Thus, this review prospects the current landscape of BM aging and explores how NGS technology is currently being applied within this ever-expanding field of research.",

			"abstract": "Most cancers are characterized by the somatic acquisition of genomic rearrangements during tumour evolution that eventually drive the oncogenesis. Here, using multiplatform sequencing technologies, we identify and characterize a remarkable mutational mechanism in human hepatocellular carcinoma caused by Hepatitis B virus, by which DNA molecules from the virus are inserted into the tumour genome causing dramatic changes in its configuration, including non-homologous chromosomal fusions, dicentric chromosomes and megabase-size telomeric deletions. This aberrant mutational mechanism, present in at least 8% of all HCC tumours, can provide the driver rearrangements that a cancer clone requires to survive and grow, including loss of relevant tumour suppressor genes. Most of these events are clonal and occur early during liver cancer evolution. Real-time timing estimation reveals some HBV-mediated rearrangements occur as early as two decades before cancer diagnosis. Overall, these data underscore the importance of characterising liver cancer genomes for patterns of HBV integration.",

			"abstract": "Despite contemporary research efforts, the prognosis of penile squamous cell carcinoma (PeSCC) has not significantly improved over the past decade. Despite frequently encountered patient-related delayed medical consultations impairing outcomes, several other aspects contribute to the lack of advancement in the treatment of this condition. One essential reason is that translational research, a prerequisite for the clinically successful disease management, is still at an early stage in PeSCC as compared to many other malignancies. Preclinical experimental models are indispensable for the evaluation of tumor biology and identification of genomic alterations. However, since neither commercial PeSCC cell lines are available nor xenograft models sustainably established, such analyses are challenging in this field of research. In addition, systemic therapies are less effective and toxic without decisive breakthroughs over recent years. Current systemic management of PeSCC is based on protocols that have been investigated in small series of only up to 30 patients. Thus, there is an unmet medical need for new approaches necessitating research efforts to develop more efficacious systemic strategies. This review aims to highlight the current state of knowledge in the molecular alterations involved in the etiology and ensuing steps for cancer progression, existing preclinical models of translational research, clinically relevant systemic protocols, and ongoing clinical trials.",

			"abstract": "Deregulated mitochondrial energetics is a metabolic hallmark of cancer cells. However, the causative mechanism of the bioenergetic deregulation is not clear. In this study, we show that somatic copy number alteration (SCNA) of mitoribosomal protein (MRP) genes is a key mechanism of bioenergetic deregulation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Association analysis between the genomic and transcriptomic profiles of 82 MRPs using The Cancer Genome Atlas-Liver HCC database identified eight key SCNA-dependent MRPs: MRPS31, MRPL10, MRPL21, MRPL15, MRPL13, MRPL55, and DAP3. MRPS31 was the only downregulated MRP harboring a DNA copy number (DCN) loss. MRPS31 loss was associated specifically with the DCN losses of many genes on chromosome 13q. Survival analysis revealed a unique dependency of HCC on the MRPS31 deficiency, showing poor clinical outcome. Subclass prediction analysis using several public classifiers indicated that MRPS31 loss is linked to aggressive HCC phenotypes. By employing hepatoma cell lines with SCNA-dependent MRPS31 expression (JHH5, HepG2, Hep3B, and SNU449), we demonstrated that MRPS31 deficiency is the key mechanism, disturbing the whole mitoribosome assembly. MRPS31 suppression enhanced hepatoma cell invasiveness by augmenting MMP7 and COL1A1 expression. Unlike the action of MMP7 on extracellular matrix destruction, COL1A1 modulated invasiveness via the ZEB1-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Finally, MRPS31 expression further stratified the high COL1A1/DDR1-expressing HCC groups into high and low overall survival, indicating that MRPS31 loss is a promising prognostic marker. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results provide new mechanistic insight for mitochondrial deregulation in HCC and present MRPS31 as a novel biomarker of HCC malignancy.",

Despite the activity of various repair mechanisms, DNA damage eventually results in the accumulation of mutations in the genomes of our cells. Oncogenic mutations are at the root of carcinogenesis, and carcinogenic agents are often highly mutagenic. Over the past decade, whole genome sequencing data of healthy and tumor tissues have revealed how cells in our body gradually accumulate mutations because of exposure to various mutagenic processes. Dissection of mutation profiles based on the type and context specificities of the altered bases has revealed a variety of signatures that reflect past exposure to environmental mutagens, ranging from chemotherapeutic drugs to genotoxic gut bacteria. In this review, we discuss the latest knowledge on somatic mutation accumulation in human cells, and how environmental mutagenic factors further shape the mutation landscapes of tissues. In addition, not all carcinogenic agents induce mutations, which may point to alternative tumor-promoting mechanisms, such as altered clonal selection dynamics. In short, we provide an overview of how environmental factors induce mutations in the DNA of our healthy cells and how this contributes to carcinogenesis. A better understanding of how environmental mutagens shape the genomes of our cells can help to identify potential preventable causes of cancer.",

KAIMRC1 cells are immortalized and shown to survive and proliferate in ligand starvation condition. Immunoblot analysis showed that mutant CSF2RB signals through JAK2/STAT and PI3K/mTOR pathways in ligand starvation conditions. Screening a small molecule kinase inhibitor library revealed potent JAK2 inhibitors against KAIMRC1 cells. We, for the first time, identified a somatic, potentially transforming, and oncogenic CSF2RB mutation (S230I) in breast cancer patients that seem to be an actionable mutation leading to the development of new therapeutics for breast cancer.",

			"abstract": "Kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) is overexpressed in several tumors and participates in the progression of breast cancer tumorigenesis, including cancer types such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). This malignant gene is an enzyme in the kynurenine pathway, which is involved in the carcinogenesis of cancer through immune function manipulation. However, it remains unclear whether the role of the KMO contributes to tumorigenesis and immune functions in human breast cancer. In this study, we found that KMO was highly expressed in different types of tumors, especially in invasive ductal breast carcinoma. In addition, KMO expression was positively correlated with the malignant clinical features of patients with breast cancer, such as TNBC and a nodal-positive status, along with patients with a higher Nottingham prognostic index (NPI). Furthermore, the top ten KMO-correlated genes were the chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines known to be involved in the progression of various cancers, therefore, KMO may facilitate breast cancers via synergistically regulating inflammatory responses in tumors with these hub genes. Taken together, these findings highlight the tumor-promotion role of KMO in breast cancers and suggest that KMO can serve as a biomarker for prognosis prediction in breast cancer patients.",

The identification of key genomic biomarkers underlying a disease are crucial for diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and therapeutic responses. The Oncomine\u2122 Comprehensive Assay v3 (OCAv3) covers 161 cancer-associated genes and is routinely employed to support clinical decision making for a therapeutic course. An improved version, Oncomine\u2122 Comprehensive Assay Plus (OCA-Plus), has been recently developed, covering 501 genes (144 overlapping with OCAv3) in addition to microsatellite instability (MSI) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) assays in one workflow. The validation of MSI and TMB was not addressed in the present study. However, the implementation of new assays must be validated and confirmed across multiple samples before it can be introduced into a clinical setting. Here, we report the comparison of DNA sequencing results from 50 ovarian cancer formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples subjected to OCAv3 and OCA-Plus. A validation assessment of gene mutations identified using OCA-Plus was performed on the 144 overlapping genes and 313,769 intersecting nucleotide positions of the OCAv3 and the OCA-Plus.

Central to these regulatory circuits are enhancers (ENHs), which are defined as cis-acting DNA elements able to increase the transcription of a target gene in a distance- and orientation-independent manner. ENHs are not independent functional elements but work in a complex and dynamic cooperative network, constituting the building blocks of multimodular domains of gene expression regulation. The information from each of these elements converges on the target promoter, contributing to improving the precision and sharpness of gene modulation. ENHs' interplay varies in its nature and extent, ranging from an additive to redundant effect depending on contexts. Moving from super-enhancers that drive the high expression levels of identity genes, to shadow-enhancers, whose redundant functions contribute to buffering the variation in gene expression, this review aims to describe the different modalities of ENHs' interaction and their role in the regulation of complex biological processes like cancer development.",

When these technologies are combined with techniques for isolating and expanding single-cell DNA, the landscape of somatic mosaicism in an individual body can be systematically revealed at a single-cell resolution. Here, we summarize three strategies (whole-genome amplification, microdissection of clonal patches in the tissue, and in vitro clonal expansion of single cells) that are currently applied for single-cell mutational analyses. Among these approaches, in vitro clonal expansion, particularly via adult stem cell-derived organoid culture technologies, yields the most sensitive and precise catalog of somatic mutations in single cells. Moreover, because it produces living mutant cells, downstream validation experiments and multiomics profiling are possible. Through the synergistic combination of organoid culture and genome sequencing, researchers can track genome changes at a single-cell resolution, which will lead to new discoveries that were previously impossible.",

To identify the potential genetic factors associated with BM, a genomic comparison for BM cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and primary lung tumor samples obtained from 1082 early- and late-stage LUAD patients was performed. We found that single nucleotide variation (SNV) of EGFR was highly enriched in CSF (87% of samples). Compared with the other primary lung tissues, copy number gain of EGFR (27%), CDK4 (11%), PMS2 (11%), MET (10%), IL7R (8%), RICTOR (7%), FLT4 (5%), and FGFR4 (4%), and copy number loss of CDKN2A (28%) and CDKN2B (18%) were remarkably more frequent in CSF samples. CSF had significantly lower tumor mutation burden (TMB) level but more abundant copy number variant. It was also found that the relationships among co-occurrent and mutually exclusive genes were dynamically changing with LUAD development. Additionally, CSF (97% of samples) harbored more abundant targeted drugs related driver and fusion genes. The signature 15 associated with defective DNA mismatch repair (dMMR) was only identified in the CSF group. Cancer associated pathway analysis further revealed that ErbB (95%) and cell cycle (84%) were unique pathways in CSF samples. The tumor evolution analysis showed that CSF carried significantly fewer clusters, but subclonal proportion of EGFR was remarkably increased with tumor progression. Collectively, CSF sequencing showed unique genomic characteristics and the intense copy number instability associated with cell cycle disorder and dMMR might be the crucial genetic factors in BM of LUAD.",

			"abstract": "Postzygotic mutations are acquired in normal tissues throughout an individual's lifetime and hold clues for identifying mutagenic factors. Here, we investigated postzygotic mutation spectra of healthy individuals using optimized ultra-deep exome sequencing of the time-series samples from the same volunteer as well as the samples from different individuals. In blood, sperm, and muscle cells, we resolved three common types of mutational signatures. Signatures A and B represent clock-like mutational processes, and the polymorphisms of epigenetic regulation genes influence the proportion of signature B in mutation profiles. Notably, signature C, characterized by C>T transitions at GpCpN sites, tends to be a feature of diverse normal tissues. Mutations of this type are likely to occur early during embryonic development, supported by their relatively high allelic frequencies, presence in multiple tissues, and decrease in occurrence with age. Almost none of the public datasets for tumors feature this signature, except for 19.6% of samples of clear cell renal cell carcinoma with increased activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway. Moreover, the accumulation of signature C in the mutation profile was accelerated in a human embryonic stem cell line with drug-induced activation of HIF-1\u03b1. Thus, embryonic hypoxia may explain this novel signature across multiple normal tissues. Our study suggests that hypoxic condition in an early stage of embryonic development is a crucial factor inducing C>T transitions at GpCpN sites; and individuals' genetic background may also influence their postzygotic mutation profiles.",

			"abstract": "DNA lesions arise from a combination of physiological/metabolic sources and exogenous environmental influences. When left unrepaired, these alterations accumulate in the cells and can give rise to mutations that change the function of important proteins (i.e. tumor suppressors, oncoproteins), or cause chromosomal rearrangements (i.e. gene fusions) that also result in the deregulation of key cellular molecules. Progressive acquisition of such genetic changes promotes uncontrolled cell proliferation and evasion of cell death, and hence plays a key role in carcinogenesis. Another less-studied consequence of DNA damage accumulating in the host genome is the integration of oncogenic DNA viruses such as Human papillomavirus, Merkel cell polyomavirus, and Hepatitis B virus. This critical step of viral-induced carcinogenesis is thought to be particularly facilitated by DNA breaks in both viral and host genomes. Therefore, the impact of DNA damage on carcinogenesis is magnified in the case of such oncoviruses via the additional effect of increasing integration frequency. In this review, we briefly present the various endogenous and exogenous factors that cause different types of DNA damage. Next, we discuss the contribution of these lesions in cancer development. Finally, we examine the amplified effect of DNA damage in viral-induced oncogenesis and summarize the limited data existing in the literature related to DNA damage-induced viral integration. To conclude, additional research is needed to assess the DNA damage pathways involved in the transition from viral infection to cancer. Discovering that a certain DNA damaging agent increases the likelihood of viral integration will enable the development of prophylactic and therapeutic strategies designed specifically to prevent such integration, with an ultimate goal of reducing or eliminating these viral-induced malignancies.",

This has resulted in a number of tumor biomarkers that have been detected in vitro and in vivo using nanodevices and corresponding imaging techniques. Atomically precise ligand-protected noble metal quantum nanoclusters represent an interesting class of nanomaterials with a great potential for the detection of tumor biomarkers. They are characterized by high biocompatibility, low toxicity, and suitability for controlled functionalization with moieties specifically recognizing tumor biomarkers. Their non-linear optical properties are of particular importance as they enable the visualization of nanocluster-labeled tumor biomarkers using non-linear optical techniques such as two-photon-excited fluorescence and second harmonic generation.

It is now widely accepted that ncRNAs play key roles in cell regulation and disease. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a form of ncRNA, characterised by a closed loop structure with roles as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), protein interactors and transcriptional regulators. Functioning as key cellular regulators, dysregulated circRNAs have a significant impact on disease progression, particularly in cancer. Evidence is emerging of specific circRNAs having oncogenic or tumour suppressive properties. The multifaceted nature of circRNA function may additionally have merit as a novel therapeutic target, either in treatment or as a novel biomarker, due to their cell-and disease-state specific expression and long-term stability. This review aims to summarise current findings on how circRNAs are dysregulated in cancer, the effects this has on disease progression, and how circRNAs may be targeted or utilised as future potential therapeutic options.",

			"abstract": "Next generation sequencing technologies (NGS) have been critical in characterizing the genomic landscape and untangling the genetic heterogeneity of human cancer. Since its advent, NGS has played a pivotal role in identifying the patterns of somatic mutations imprinted on cancer genomes and in deciphering the signatures of the mutational processes that have generated these patterns. Mutational signatures serve as phenotypic molecular footprints of exposures to environmental factors as well as deficiency and infidelity of DNA replication and repair pathways. Since the first roadmap of mutational signatures in human cancer was generated from whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing data, there has been a growing interest to extract mutational signatures from other NGS technologies such as targeted panel sequencing, RNA sequencing, single-cell sequencing, duplex sequencing, reduced representation sequencing, and long-read sequencing. Many of these technologies have their inherent sequencing biases and produce technical artifacts that can confound the extraction of reliable and interpretable mutational signatures. In this review, we highlight the relevance, limitations, and prospects of using different NGS technologies for examining mutational patterns and for deciphering mutational signatures.",

As a complement of previous studies based on cell lines or xenografts, organoids provide a 3D platform for mutation-carcinogenesis modeling, high-throughput drug screening, genetic engineering, and biobanking, which might fulfill the gap between basic research and clinical practice. Stepwise, cutting-edge bioengineering techniques of organoid-on-a-chip and 3D bioprinting might converge current challenges and contribute to personalized therapy. We comprehensively reviewed the advantages, challenges, and translational potential of OC organoids.

Throughout years, complexity of cancer progression and invasion, high prevalence and incidence, as well as the high rise in treatment failure cases leading to a poor patient prognosis accounted for continuous experimental investigations on animals and cellular models, mainly with 2D- and 3D-cell culture. Nowadays, these research models are considered a main asset to reflect the physiological events in many cancer types in terms of cellular characteristics and features, replication and metastatic mechanisms, metabolic pathways, biomarkers expression, and chemotherapeutic agent resistance. In practice, based on research perspective and hypothesis, scientists aim to choose the best model to approach their understanding and to prove their hypothesis. Recently, 3D-cell models are seen to be highly incorporated as a crucial tool for reflecting the true cancer cell microenvironment in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics studies, in addition to the intensity of anticancer drug response in pharmacogenomics trials. Hence, in this review, we shed light on the unique characteristics of 3D cells favoring its promising usage through a comparative approach with other research models, specifically 2D-cell culture. Plus, we will discuss the importance of 3D models as a direct reflector of the intrinsic cancer cell environment with the newest multiple methods and types available for 3D-cells implementation.",

			"abstract": "Cutaneous melanoma remains a severe public health threat, with annual incidence increasing slowly but steadily over 4 decades. While early-stage melanomas can typically be treated with complete surgical excision with favorable results, the development of metastatic cancer, which is related to a lower survival rate, is linked to the primary tumor's rising stage and other high-risk features. Even though the first discoveries of an immunological anti-tumor response were published about a century ago, immunotherapy has only been a feasible therapeutic option for cutaneous melanoma in the last 30\u00a0years. Nonetheless, for the treatment of various cancers, including metastatic melanoma, the area of cancer immunotherapy has made significant progress in the last decade. As a result, melanoma continues to be the subject of several preclinical and clinical investigations to further understand cancer immunobiology and test different tumor immunotherapies. Immunotherapy's resistance to radiation and cytotoxic chemotherapy is one of its most distinguishing features. Furthermore, the discovery of biomarkers will aid in patient stratification and management during immunotherapy treatment.\u00a0In this article, we discuss current knowledge and recent developments in immune-mediated therapy of melanoma.",

			"abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are a type of sarcoma that generally originates from Schwann cells. The prognosis for this type of malignancy is relatively poor due to complicated genetic alterations and the lack of specific targeted therapy. Chromosome fragment 4q22-23 is frequently deleted in MPNSTs and other human tumors, suggesting tumor suppressor genes may reside in this region. Here, we provide evidence that SMARCAD1, a known chromatin remodeler, is a novel tumor suppressor gene located in 4q22-23. We identified two human homologous smarcad1 genes (smarcad1a and smarcad1b) in zebrafish, and both genes share overlapping expression patterns during embryonic development. We demonstrated that two smarcad1a loss-of-function mutants, sa1299 and p403, can accelerate MPNST tumorigenesis in the tp53 mutant background, suggesting smarcad1a is a bona fide tumor suppressor gene for MPNSTs. Moreover, we found that DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair might be compromised in both mutants compared to wildtype zebrafish, as indicated by pH2AX, a DNA DSB marker. In addition, both SMARCAD1 gene knockdown and overexpression in human cells were able to inhibit tumor growth and displayed similar DSB repair responses, suggesting proper SMARCAD1 gene expression level or gene dosage is critical for cell growth. Given that mutations of SMARCAD1 sensitize cells to poly ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors in yeast and the human U2OS osteosarcoma cell line, the identification of SMARCAD1 as a novel tumor suppressor gene might contribute to the development of new cancer therapies for MPNSTs.",

However, capturing biological data with highly nonlinear and complex associations by most existing approaches for cancer diagnosis has been challenging. In this study, we propose a novel hierarchical feature selection and second learning probability error ensemble model (named HFS-SLPEE) for precision cancer diagnosis. Specifically, we first integrated protein-coding gene expression profiles, non-coding RNA expression profiles, and DNA methylation data to provide rich information; afterward, we designed a novel hierarchical feature selection method, which takes the CpG-gene biological associations into account and can select a compact set of superior features; next, we used four individual classifiers with significant differences and apparent complementary to build the heterogeneous classifiers; lastly, we developed a second learning probability error ensemble model called SLPEE to thoroughly learn the new data consisting of classifiers-predicted class probability values and the actual label, further realizing the self-correction of the diagnosis errors. Benchmarking comparisons on TCGA showed that HFS-SLPEE performs better than the state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we analyzed in-depth 10 groups of selected features and found several novel HFS-SLPEE-predicted epigenomics and epigenetics biomarkers for breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) (e.g., TSLP and ADAMTS9-AS2), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) (e.g., HBA1 and CTB-43E15.1), and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) (e.g., IRX2 and BMPR1B-AS1).",

Yet, within a single tumor there is often extensive genetic heterogeneity as evidenced by single-cell and bulk DNA sequencing data. The goal of this work is to jointly infer the underlying genotypes of tumor subpopulations and the distribution of those subpopulations in individual tumors by integrating single-cell and bulk sequencing data. Understanding the genetic composition of the tumor at the time of treatment is important in the personalized design of targeted therapeutic combinations and monitoring for possible recurrence after treatment. We propose a hierarchical Dirichlet process mixture model that incorporates the correlation structure induced by a structured sampling arrangement and we show that this model improves the quality of inference. We develop a representation of the hierarchical Dirichlet process prior as a Gamma-Poisson hierarchy and we use this representation to derive a fast Gibbs sampling inference algorithm using the augment-and-marginalize method. Experiments with simulation data show that our model outperforms standard numerical and statistical methods for decomposing admixed count data. Analyses of real acute lymphoblastic leukemia cancer sequencing dataset shows that our model improves upon state-of-the-art bioinformatic methods.

However, it is still challenging to correctly detect CNVs of different lengths. It is necessary to develop new CNV detection tools to meet this demand. In this work, we propose a new CNV detection method, called CBCNV, for the detection of CNVs of different lengths from whole genome sequencing data. CBCNV uses a clustering algorithm to divide the read depth segment profile, and assigns an abnormal score to each read depth segment. Based on the abnormal score profile, Tukey's fences method is adopted in CBCNV to forecast CNVs. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on simulated data sets, and is compared with those of several existing methods. The experimental results prove that the performance of CBCNV is better than those of several existing methods. The proposed method is further tested and verified on real data sets, and the experimental results are found to be consistent with the simulation results. Therefore, the proposed method can be expected to become a routine tool in the analysis of CNVs from tumor-normal matched samples.",

			"abstract": "Tumour formation involves random mutagenic events and positive evolutionary selection acting on a subset of such events, referred to as driver mutations. A decade of careful surveying of tumour DNA using exome-based analyses has revealed a multitude of protein-coding somatic driver mutations, some of which are clinically actionable. Today, a transition towards whole-genome analysis is well under way, technically enabling the discovery of potential driver mutations occurring outside protein-coding sequences. Mutations are abundant in this vast non-coding space, which is more than 50 times larger than the coding exome, but reliable identification of selection signals in non-coding DNA remains a challenge. In this Review, we discuss recent findings in the field, where the emerging landscape is one in which non-coding driver mutations appear to be relatively infrequent. Nevertheless, we highlight several notable discoveries. We consider possible reasons for the relative absence of non-coding driver events, as well as the difficulties associated with detecting signals of positive selection in non-coding DNA.",

			"abstract": "Sporadic cancer develops from the accrual of somatic mutations. Out of all small-scale somatic aberrations in coding regions, 95% are base substitutions, with 90% being missense mutations. While multiple studies focused on the importance of this mutation type, a machine learning method based on the number of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) has not been fully explored. This study aims to develop an improved computational method for driver identification, validation and evaluation (DRIVE), which is compared to other methods for assessing its performance. DRIVE aims at distinguishing between driver and passenger mutations using a feature-based learning approach comprising two levels of biological classification for a pan-cancer assessment of somatic mutations. Gene-level features include the maximum number of protein-protein interactions, the biological process and the type of post-translational modifications (PTMs) while mutation-level features are based on pathogenicity scores. Multiple supervised classification algorithms were trained on Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) project data and then tested on an independent dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) study. Finally, the most powerful classifier using DRIVE was evaluated on a benchmark dataset, which showed a better overall performance compared to other state-of-the-art methodologies, however, considerable care must be taken due to the reduced size of the dataset. DRIVE outlines the outstanding potential that multiple levels of a feature-based learning model will play in the future of oncology-based precision medicine.",

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has critical functions in development and tumorigenesis and may help improve the molecular mechanisms of digestive system tumors. However, current understanding of the reconstitution of m6A in digestive system tumors is far from comprehensive. Herein, this study systematically analyzed multi-layered genomic characteristics and clinical relevance of m6A regulators in 1906 patients involving seven digestive system tumor types. We discovered that m6A regulators showed extensive genetic changes and highly consistent expression regulation. The m6A expression was closely related to the activity of cancer pathways. At the same time, we also identified m6A regulators significantly related to the common cancer pathways of digestive system tumors and specific cancer pathways of digestive tract and digestive glands. These cancer pathways may explain the prognostic differences of patients with digestive tract tumors. In addition, m6A regulators demonstrated strong potential in prognostic stratification and drug development, especially in multiple research cohorts on pancreatic cancer, pointing to a strong prognostic stratification capability of m6A regulators. Finally, a m6A scoring model significantly related to highly active ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, mismatch repair, cell cycle, ebasal transcription factors was constructed and had a strong prognostic stratification ability in digestive gland tumors. The score showed a significant negative correlation with the tumor immune microenvironment. This study demonstrated that the similarities and difference of the action mechanism m6A regulators in the digestive tract and digestive gland tumor progression could guide potential drug development.",

			"abstract": "Cancer genomes harbor numerous genomic alterations and many cancers accumulate thousands of nucleotide sequence variations. A prominent fraction of these mutations arises as a consequence of the off-target activity of DNA/RNA editing cytosine deaminases followed by the replication/repair of edited sites by DNA polymerases (pol), as deduced from the analysis of the DNA sequence context of mutations in different tumor tissues. We have used the weight matrix (sequence profile) approach to analyze mutagenesis due to Activation Induced Deaminase (AID) and two error-prone DNA polymerases. Control experiments using shuffled weight matrices and somatic mutations in immunoglobulin genes confirmed the power of this method. Analysis of somatic mutations in various cancers suggested that AID and DNA polymerases \u03b7 and \u03b8 contribute to mutagenesis in contexts that almost universally correlate with the context of mutations in A:T and G:C sites during the affinity maturation of immunoglobulin genes. Previously, we demonstrated that AID contributes to mutagenesis in (de)methylated genomic DNA in various cancers. Our current analysis of methylation data from malignant lymphomas suggests that driver genes are subject to different (de)methylation processes than non-driver genes and, in addition to AID, the activity of pols \u03b7 and \u03b8 contributes to the establishment of methylation-dependent mutation profiles. This may reflect the functional importance of interplay between mutagenesis in cancer and (de)methylation processes in different groups of genes. The resulting changes in CpG methylation levels and chromatin modifications are likely to cause changes in the expression levels of driver genes that may affect cancer initiation and/or progression.",

Although several computational approaches have been developed for distinguishing between driver and passenger mutations, very few have concentrated on using the raw nucleotide sequences surrounding a particular mutation as potential features for building predictive models. Using experimentally validated cancer mutation data in this study, we explored various string-based feature representation techniques to incorporate information on the neighborhood bases immediately 5' and 3' from each mutated position. Density estimation methods showed significant distributional differences between the neighborhood bases surrounding driver and passenger mutations. Binary classification models derived using repeated cross-validation experiments provided comparable performances across all window sizes. Integrating sequence features derived from raw nucleotide sequences with other genomic, structural, and evolutionary features resulted in the development of a pan-cancer mutation effect prediction tool, NBDriver, which was highly efficient in identifying pathogenic variants from five independent validation datasets. An ensemble predictor obtained by combining the predictions from NBDriver with three other commonly used driver prediction tools (FATHMM (cancer), CONDEL, and MutationTaster) significantly outperformed existing pan-cancer models in prioritizing a literature-curated list of driver and passenger mutations. Using the list of true positive mutation predictions derived from NBDriver, we identified a list of 138 known driver genes with functional evidence from various sources. Overall, our study underscores the efficacy of using raw nucleotide sequences as features to distinguish between driver and passenger mutations from sequenced cancer genomes.",

The accumulation of omics big sequence data led to the development of various genetic databases on which clinical stratification of high-risk populations may be conducted. In addition, because cancers are generally caused by tumor-specific mutations, large-scale systematic identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in various tumors has propelled significant progress of tailored treatments of tumors (i.e., precision oncology). Machine learning (ML), a subfield of artificial intelligence in which computers learn through experience, has a great potential to be used in precision oncology chiefly to help physicians make diagnostic decisions based on tumor images. A promising venue of ML in precision oncology is the integration of all available data from images to multi-omics big data for the holistic care of patients and high-risk healthy subjects.

Although studies have been conducted to elucidate the etiology of multiple primary malignancies (MPM) after a BC diagnosis, few studies have investigated other previously diagnosed primary malignancies (OPPM) before BC. Here, genome-wide profiling was used to identify potential driver DNA copy number alterations and somatic mutations that promote the development of MPMs. To compare the genomic profiles for two primary tumors (BC and OPPM) from the same patient, tumor pairs from 26 young women (\u226450\u00a0years) diagnosed with one or more primary malignancies before breast cancer were analyzed. Malignant melanoma was the most frequent OPPM, followed by gynecologic- and hematologic malignancies. However, significantly more genetic alterations were detected in BC compared to the OPPM. BC also showed more genetic similarity as a group than the tumor pairs. Clonality testing showed that genetic alterations on chromosomes 1, 3, 16, and 19 were concordant in both tumors in 13 patients. TP53 mutations were also found to be prevalent in BC, MM, and HM. Although all samples were classified as genetically unstable, chromothripsis-like patterns were primarily observed in BC. Taken together, few recurrent genetic alterations were identified in both tumor pairs that can explain the development of MPMs in the same patient.

			"abstract": "For several decades, the somatic mutation theory (SMT) has been the dominant paradigm on cancer research, leading to the textbook notion that cancer is fundamentally a genetic disease. However, recent discoveries indicate that mutations, including \"oncogenic\" ones, are widespread in normal somatic cells, suggesting that mutations may be necessary but not sufficient for cancer to develop. Indeed, a fundamental but as yet unanswered question is whether or not the first step in oncogenesis corresponds to a mutational event. On the other hand, for some time, it has been acknowledged the important role in cancer progression of molecular processes that participate in buffering cellular stress. However, their role is considered secondary or complementary to that of putative oncogenic mutations. Here we present and discuss evidence that cancer may have its origin in epigenetic processes associated with cellular adaptation to stressful conditions, and so it could be a direct consequence of stress-buffering mechanisms that allow cells with aberrant phenotypes (not necessarily associated with genetic mutations) to survive and propagate within the organism. We put forward the hypothesis that there would be an inverse correlation between the activation threshold of the cellular stress responses (CSRs) and the risk of cancer, so that species or individuals with low-threshold CSRs will display a higher incidence or risk of cancer.",

			"abstract": "Substantial studies indicate that autoantibodies to tumor-associated antigens (TAAbs) arise in early stage of lung cancer (LC). However, since single TAAbs as non-invasive biomarkers reveal low diagnostic performances, a panel approach is needed to provide more clues for early detection of LC. In the present research, potential TAAbs were screened in 150 serum samples by focused protein array based on 154 proteins encoded by cancer driver genes. Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to verify and validate TAAbs in two independent datasets with 1,054 participants (310 in verification cohort, 744 in validation cohort). In both verification and validation cohorts, eight TAAbs were higher in serum of LC patients compared with normal controls. Moreover, diagnostic models were built and evaluated in the training set and the test set of validation cohort by six data mining methods. In contrast to the other five models, the decision tree (DT) model containing seven TAAbs (TP53, NPM1, FGFR2, PIK3CA, GNA11, HIST1H3B, and TSC1), built in the training set, yielded the highest diagnostic value with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.897, the sensitivity of 94.4% and the specificity of 84.9%. The model was further assessed in the test set and exhibited an AUC of 0.838 with the sensitivity of 89.4% and the specificity of 78.2%. Interestingly, the accuracies of this model in both early and advanced stage were close to 90%, much more effective than that of single TAAbs. Protein array based on cancer driver genes is effective in screening and discovering potential TAAbs of LC. The TAAbs panel with TP53, NPM1, FGFR2, PIK3CA, GNA11, HIST1H3B, and TSC1 is excellent in early detection of LC, and they might be new target in LC immunotherapy.",

			"abstract": "The CBFB gene is frequently mutated in several types of solid tumors. Emerging evidence suggests that CBFB is a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. However, our understanding of the tumor suppressive function of CBFB remains incomplete. Here, we analyze genetic interactions between mutations of CBFB and other highly mutated genes in human breast cancer datasets and find that CBFB and TP53 mutations are mutually exclusive, suggesting a functional association between CBFB and p53. Integrated genomic studies reveal that TAp73 is a common transcriptional target of CBFB and p53. CBFB cooperates with p53 to maintain TAp73 expression, as either CBFB or p53 loss leads to TAp73 depletion. TAp73 re-expression abrogates the tumorigenic effect of CBFB deletion. Although TAp73 loss alone is insufficient for tumorigenesis, it enhances the tumorigenic effect of NOTCH3 overexpression, a downstream event of CBFB loss. Immunohistochemistry shows that p73 loss is coupled with higher proliferation in xenografts. Moreover, TAp73 loss-of-expression is a frequent event in human breast cancer tumors and cell lines. Together, our results significantly advance our understanding of the tumor suppressive functions of CBFB and reveal a mechanism underlying the communication between the two tumor suppressors CBFB and p53.",

			"abstract": "Our previous integrative study in gastric cancer discovered cryptic promoter activation events that drive the expression of important developmental genes. However, it was unclear if such cancer-associated epigenetic changes occurred in cancer cells or other cell types in bulk tissue samples. An integrative analysis consisting of RNA-Seq and H3K4me3 ChIP-Seq was used. This workflow was applied to a set of matched normal lung tissues and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues, for which the stroma and tumor cell parts could be isolated by laser-microdissection microscopy (LMD). RNA-Seq analysis showed subtype-specific differential expressed genes and enriched pathways in NSCLC. ChIP-Seq analysis results suggested that the proximal altered H3K4me3 regions were located at differentially expressed genes involved in cancer-related pathways, while altered distal H3K4me3 regions were annotated with enhancer activity of cancer regulatory genes. Interestingly, integration with ENCODE data revealed that proximal tumor-gained promoters were associated with EZH2 and SUZ12 occupancies, which are the core components of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). This study used LMD on clinical samples for an integrative analysis to overcome the tissue heterogeneity problem in cancer research. The results also contribute to the overall understanding of genetic and epigenetic dysregulation of lung malignancy.",

			"abstract": "Children show a higher incidence of leukaemia compared with young adolescents, yet their cells are less damaged because of their young age. Children with Down syndrome (DS) have an even higher risk of developing leukaemia during the first years of life. The presence of a constitutive trisomy of chromosome 21 (T21) in DS acts as a genetic driver for leukaemia development, however, additional oncogenic mutations are required. Therefore, T21 provides the opportunity to better understand leukaemogenesis in children. Here, we describe the increased risk of leukaemia in DS during childhood from a somatic evolutionary view. According to this idea, cancer is caused by a variation in inheritable phenotypes within cell populations that are subjected to selective forces within the tissue context. We propose a model in which the increased risk of leukaemia in DS children derives from higher rates of mutation accumulation, already present during fetal development, which is further enhanced by changes in selection dynamics within the fetal liver niche. This model could possibly be used to understand the rate-limiting steps of leukaemogenesis early in life.",

			"abstract": "Radiotherapy and surgery are curative treatment options for localized prostate cancer (PCa) with a 5-year survival rate of nearly 100%. Once PCa cells spread into distant organs, such as bone, the overall survival rate of patients drops dramatically. The metastatic cascade and organotropism of PCa cells are regulated by different cellular subtypes, organ microenvironment, and their interactions. This cross-talk leads to pre-metastatic niche formation that releases chemo-attractive factors enforcing the formation of distant metastasis. Biological characteristics of PCa metastasis impacting on metastatic sites, burden, and latency is of clinical relevance. Therefore, the implementation of modern hybrid imaging technologies into clinical routine increased the sensitivity to detect metastases at earlier stages. This enlarged the number of PCa patients diagnosed with a limited number of metastases, summarized as oligometastatic disease. These patients can be treated with androgen deprivation in combination with local-ablative radiotherapy or radiopharmaceuticals directed to metastatic sites. Unfortunately, the number of patients with disease recurrence is high due to the enormous heterogeneity within the oligometastatic patient population and the lack of available biomarkers with predictive potential for metastasis-directed radiotherapy. Another, so far unmet clinical need is the diagnosis of minimal residual disease before onset of clinical manifestation and/or early relapse after initial therapy. Here, monitoring of circulating and disseminating tumor cells in PCa patients during the course of radiotherapy may give us novel insight into how metastatic spread is influenced by radiotherapy and vice versa. In summary, this review critically compares current clinical concepts for metastatic PCa patients and discuss the implementation of recent preclinical findings improving our understanding of metastatic dissemination and radiotherapy resistance into standard of care.",

Cancer is a complex process that is characterized by multiple genetic and epigenetic changes resulting in abnormal cell growth and proliferation. As cancer is one of the leading causes of deaths worldwide, a large number of studies are done to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of cancer. Because of its high efficiency and specificity, CRISPR/Cas9 has emerged as a novel and powerful tool in the field of cancer research. CRISPR/Cas9 has the potential to accelerate cancer research by dissecting tumorigenesis process, generating animal and cellular models, and identify drug targets for chemotherapeutic approaches. However, despite having tremendous potential, there are certain challenges associated with CRISPR/Cas9 such as safe delivery to the target, potential off-target effects and its efficacy which needs to be addressed prior to its clinical application. In this review, we give a gist of different genome-editing technologies with a special focus on CRISPR/Cas9 development, its mechanism of action and its applications, especially in different type of cancers.

Actually, unbiased transcriptome analysis revealed a marked cell cycle signature in ABZ exposed cells. Indeed, short-term exposure to ABZ arrested mammalian cells in G2/M cell cycle stages associated with frequent gains and losses of chromatin. Cellular analyses revealed ABZ as a potent mammalian spindle poison for normal and malignant cells, explaining the serious chromosome segregation defects. Since chromosomal aberrations promote both cancer development and cell death, we determined if besides its general cytotoxicity, ABZ could predispose to tumor development.

			"abstract": "The characterization of cancer genomes has provided insight into somatically altered genes across tumors, transformed our understanding of cancer biology, and enabled tailoring of therapeutic strategies. However, the function of most cancer alleles remains mysterious, and many cancer features transcend their genomes. Consequently, tumor genomic characterization does not influence therapy for most patients. Approaches to understand the function and circuitry of cancer genes provide complementary approaches to elucidate both oncogene and non-oncogene dependencies. Emerging work indicates that the diversity of therapeutic targets engendered by non-oncogene dependencies is much larger than the list of recurrently mutated genes. Here we describe a framework for this expanded list of cancer targets, providing novel opportunities for clinical translation.",

The methylation, CNVs and expression profiles of CNV-Gs and MET-Gs were analyzed by consistent clustering using iCluster integration, here, we determined three subtypes (iC1, iC2, iC3) with different molecular traits, prognostic characteristics and tumor immune microenvironment features. We also identified 4 prognostic genes (CLDN3, FAM221A, GDF15 and YBX2) differentially expressed in the three subtypes, and could therefore be used as representative biomarkers for the three subtypes of EC. In conclusion, by performing comprehensive analysis on genomic, epigenetic and transcriptomic regulations, the current study provided new insights into the multilayer molecular and pathological traits of EC, and contributed to the precision medication for EC patients.",

Basic and clinical research applications of CRISPR-Cas9-based technologies and ongoing clinical trials in this area have demonstrated the potential of genome editing to cure human disease. Evaluation of research and clinical trials in gene therapy reveals a concentration of activity in prostate cancer research and practice. Multiple aspects of prostate cancer care - including anatomical considerations that enable direct tumour injections and sampling, the availability of preclinical immune-competent models and the delineation of tumour-related antigens that might provide targets for an induced immune system - make gene therapy an appealing treatment option for this common malignancy. Vaccine-based therapies that induce an immune response and new technologies exploiting CRISPR-Cas9-assisted approaches, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies, are very promising and are currently under investigation both in the laboratory and in the clinic. Although laboratory and preclinical advances have, thus far, not led to oncologically relevant outcomes in the clinic, future studies offer great promise for gene therapy to become established in prostate cancer care.",

			"abstract": "To understand the mechanisms that mediate germline genetic leukemia predisposition, we studied the inherited ribosomopathy Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS), a bone marrow failure disorder with high risk of myeloid malignancies at an early age. To define the mechanistic basis of clonal hematopoiesis in SDS, we investigate somatic mutations acquired by patients with SDS followed longitudinally. Here we report that multiple independent somatic hematopoietic clones arise early in life, most commonly harboring heterozygous mutations in EIF6 or TP53. We show that germline SBDS deficiency establishes a fitness constraint that drives selection of somatic clones via two distinct mechanisms with different clinical consequences. EIF6 inactivation mediates a compensatory pathway with limited leukemic potential by ameliorating the underlying SDS ribosome defect and enhancing clone fitness. TP53 mutations define a maladaptive pathway with enhanced leukemic potential by inactivating tumor suppressor checkpoints without correcting the ribosome defect. Subsequent development of leukemia was associated with acquisition of biallelic TP53 alterations. These results mechanistically link leukemia predisposition to germline genetic constraints on cellular fitness, and provide a rational framework for clinical surveillance strategies.",

Thus, they play an important role in the occurrence and development of tumors, and they are closely related to tumor invasion, metastasis, drug resistance, and recurrence after treatment. Therefore, specific targeting of CSCs may improve the efficiency of cancer therapy. A series of corresponding promising therapeutic strategies based on CSC targeting, such as the targeting of CSC niche, CSC signaling pathways, and CSC mitochondria, are currently under development. Given the rapid progression in this field and nanotechnology, drug delivery systems (DDSs) for CSC targeting are increasingly being developed. In this review, we summarize the advances in CSC-targeted DDSs. Furthermore, we highlight the latest developmental trends through the main line of CSC occurrence and development process; some considerations about the rationale, advantages, and limitations of different DDSs for CSC-targeted therapies were discussed.",

Nanomaterials have multiple advantages over other materials due to their small size and high surface area, which allow retention and controlled drug release to improve the anti-cancer property. Most cancer therapies have been known to damage healthy cells due to poor specificity, which can be avoided by using nanosized particles. Nanomaterials can be combined with various types of biomaterials to make it less toxic and improve its biocompatibility. Based on these properties, several nanomaterials have been developed which possess excellent anti-cancer efficacy potential and improved diagnosis.

			"abstract": "Alterations in global epigenetic signatures on chromatin are well established to contribute to tumor initiation and progression. Chromatin methylation status modulates several key cellular processes that maintain the integrity of the genome. KDM4A, a demethylase that belongs to the Fe-II dependent dioxygenase family that uses \u03b1-ketoglutarate and molecular oxygen as cofactors, is overexpressed in several cancers and is associated with an overall poor prognosis. KDM4A demethylates lysine 9 (H3K9me2/3) and lysine 36 (H3K36me3) methyl marks on histone H3. Given the complexity that exists with these marks on chromatin and their effects on transcription and proliferation, it naturally follows that demethylation serves an equally important role in these cellular processes. In this review, we highlight the role of KDM4A in transcriptional modulation, either dependent or independent of its enzymatic activity, arising from the amplification of this demethylase in cancer. KDM4A modulates re-replication of distinct genomic loci, activates cell cycle inducers, and represses proteins involved in checkpoint control giving rise to proliferative damage, mitotic disturbances and chromosomal breaks, ultimately resulting in genomic instability. In parallel, emerging evidence of non-nuclear substrates of epigenetic modulators emphasize the need to investigate the role of KDM4A in regulating non-nuclear substrates and evaluate their contribution to genomic instability in this context. The existence of promising KDM-specific inhibitors makes these demethylases an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in cancers.",

Although the functions of a majority of lncRNAs have yet to be clarified, some lncRNAs have been shown to be associated with human diseases such as cancer. LncRNAs have been shown to contribute to many important cancer phenotypes through their interactions with other cellular macromolecules including DNA, protein and RNA. Here we describe the literature regarding the biogenesis and features of lncRNAs. We also present an overview of the current knowledge regarding the roles of lncRNAs in cancer from the view of various aspects of cellular homeostasis, including proliferation, survival, migration and genomic stability. Furthermore, we discuss the methodologies used to identify the function of lncRNAs in cancer development and tumorigenesis.

However, the role of Parthanatos in sevoflurane-induced neonatal neuronal cell death has not been investigated. To test it, neuronal cells treated with 2, 4, and 8% sevoflurane for 6, 12, and 24 h and postnatal day 7 rats exposed to 2.5% sevoflurane for 6 h were used in the present study. Our results found sevoflurane exposure induced neuronal cell death, which was accompanied by PARP-1 hyperactivation, cytoplasmic polymerized ADP-ribose (PAR) accumulation, mitochondrial depolarization, and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) nuclear translocation in the neuronal cells and hippocampi of rats. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of PAPR-1 significantly alleviated sevoflurane-induced neuronal cell death and accumulation of PAR polymer and AIF nuclear translocation, which were consistent with the features of Parthanatos.

The significant molecular heterogeneity across individual tumors even within the same tissue context complicates decoding the key etiologic mechanisms of this disease. Furthermore, it is increasingly likely that biologic mechanisms underlying the pathobiology of cancer involve multiple molecular entities interacting across functional scales. This has motivated the development of computational approaches that integrate molecular measurements with prior biological knowledge in increasingly intricate ways to enable the discovery of driver genomic aberrations across cancers. Here, we review diverse methodological approaches that have powered significant advances in our understanding of the genomic underpinnings of cancer at the cohort and at the individual tumor scales. We outline the key advances and challenges in the computational discovery of cancer mechanisms while motivating the development of systems biology approaches to comprehensively decode the biologic drivers of this complex disease.",

Here, we identified the deadliest universal drivers for all cancers via developing algorithms to analyze massive RNAseqs and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In general, noncoding RNAs primarily serve as the most important inducers and suppressors for all types of cancers. In particular, pseudogenes are primary inducers, and specifically the antisense RNA RP11-335K5.2 serves as the most universal cancerous driver, independently of the cancer type and condition. Therefore, noncoding RNAs, instead of proteins as conventionally thought, primarily drive cancer, which establishes a novel field for future cancer research and therapy.",

However, the cell of origin is a B-lymphocyte acquiring aberrant genomic events in the germinal center of a lymph node as off-target events during somatichypermutation and class-switch recombination driven by activation-induced-deaminase. Whether pre-germinal center events are also required for transformation, and which additional events are required for disease progression is still matter of debate. As early treatment in asymptomatic phases is gaining traction in the clinic, a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of myeloma progression would allow stratification of patients based on their risk of progression, thus rationalizing efficacy and cost of clinical interventions. In this review, we will discuss the development of MM, from the cell of origin through asymptomatic stages such as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and smoldering MM, to the development of symptomatic disease. We will explain the genetic heterogeneity of MM, one of the major drivers of disease recurrence.

This study aimed at establishment, characterization and therapy testing of colorectal carcinoma-derived PDX. We generated 49 PDX and validated identity between patient tumor and corresponding PDX. Sensitivity of PDX toward conventional and targeted drugs revealed that 92% of PDX responded toward irinotecan, 45% toward 5-FU, 65% toward bevacizumab, and 61% toward cetuximab. Expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands correlated to the sensitivity toward cetuximab. Proto-oncogene B-RAF, EGFR, Kirsten rat sarcoma virus oncogene homolog gene copy number correlated positively with cetuximab and erlotinib sensitivity. The mutational analyses revealed an individual mutational profile of PDX and mainly identical profiles of PDX from primary tumor vs corresponding metastasis. Mutation in PIK3CA was a determinant of accelerated tumor doubling time. PDX with wildtype Kirsten rat sarcoma virus oncogene homolog, proto-oncogene B-RAF, and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinaseM catalytic subunit alfa showed higher sensitivity toward cetuximab and erlotinib. To study the molecular mechanism of cetuximab resistance, cetuximab resistant PDX models were generated, and changes in HER2, HER3, betacellulin, transforming growth factor alfa were observed. Global proteome and phosphoproteome profiling showed a reduction in canonical EGFR-mediated signaling via PTPN11 (SHP2) and AKT1S1 (PRAS40) and an increase in anti-apoptotic signaling as a consequence of acquired cetuximab resistance. This demonstrates that PDX models provide a multitude of possibilities to identify and validate biomarkers, signaling pathways and resistance mechanisms for clinically relevant improvement in cancer therapy.",

Regardless of mechanism, mutations are subject to selection, and some hotspots can manifest in disease.

These processes leave mutational patterns on the cancer genomes, which are referred to as mutational signatures. Recently, 81 mutational signatures have been inferred using computational algorithms on sequencing data of 23,879 samples. However, these published signatures may not always offer a comprehensive view on the biological processes underlying tumour types that are not included or underrepresented in the reference studies. To circumvent this problem, we designed CaMuS (Cancer Mutational Signatures) to construct de novo signatures while simultaneously fitting publicly available mutational signatures. Furthermore, we propose to estimate signature similarity by comparing probability distributions using the Hellinger distance. We applied CaMuS to infer signatures of mutational processes in poorly studied cancer types. We used whole genome sequencing data of 56 neuroblastoma, thus providing evidence for the versatility of CaMuS. Using simulated data, we compared the performance of CaMuS to sigfit, a recently developed algorithm with comparable inference functionalities. CaMuS and sigfit reconstructed the simulated datasets with similar accuracy; however two main features may argue for CaMuS over sigfit: (i) superior computational performance and (ii) a reliable parameter selection method to avoid spurious signatures.",

			"abstract": "Glioblastomas remain the deadliest brain tumour, with a dismal \u223c12-16-month survival from diagnosis. Therefore, identification of new diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic tools to tackle glioblastomas is urgently needed. Emerging evidence indicates that the cellular machinery controlling the splicing process (spliceosome) is altered in tumours, leading to oncogenic splicing events associated with tumour progression and aggressiveness. Here, we identify for the first time a profound dysregulation in the expression of relevant spliceosome components and splicing factors (at mRNA and protein levels) in well characterized cohorts of human high-grade astrocytomas, mostly glioblastomas, compared to healthy brain control samples, being SRSF3, RBM22, PTBP1 and RBM3 able to perfectly discriminate between tumours and control samples, and between proneural-like or mesenchymal-like tumours versus control samples from different mouse models with gliomas. Results were confirmed in four additional and independent human cohorts. Silencing of SRSF3, RBM22, PTBP1 and RBM3 decreased aggressiveness parameters in vitro (e.g. proliferation, migration, tumorsphere-formation, etc.) and induced apoptosis, especially SRSF3. Remarkably, SRSF3 was correlated with patient survival and relevant tumour markers, and its silencing in vivo drastically decreased tumour development and progression, likely through a molecular/cellular mechanism involving PDGFRB and associated oncogenic signalling pathways (PI3K-AKT/ERK), which may also involve the distinct alteration of alternative splicing events of specific transcription factors controlling PDGFRB (i.e. TP73). Altogether, our results demonstrate a drastic splicing machinery-associated molecular dysregulation in glioblastomas, which could potentially be considered as a source of novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers as well as therapeutic targets for glioblastomas. Remarkably, SRSF3 is directly associated with glioblastoma development, progression, aggressiveness and patient survival and represents a novel potential therapeutic target to tackle this devastating pathology.",

Despite tamoxifen being considered a reliable chemopreventive in high-risk individuals and an effective adjuvant therapy for hormone-sensitive tumours, mortality has remained high among breast cancer patients in the West African region where Nigeria belongs. The Nigerian breast cancer population, like other similar patient-populations in the West African region, provides a mix of intrinsic genome-diversity and perhaps unique tumour biology and evolution. These peculiarities suggest the need for a rational approach to tumour management and a personalised delivery of therapy in Nigeria's dominant estrogen-receptor-positive patient population. Herein, critical indices of tamoxifen-therapy success are discussed in the context of the Nigerian breast cancer population with emphasis on salient aspects of tamoxifen-biotransformation, host- and tumour-genomics, and epigenetics.",

Our software provides advanced functions for importing DNA variants, computing mutation types, and extracting mutational signatures via non-negative matrix factorization. Specifically, mutSignatures accepts multiple types of input data, is compatible with non-human genomes, and supports the analysis of non-standard mutation types, such as tetra-nucleotide mutation types. We applied mutSignatures to analyze somatic mutations found in smoking-related cancer datasets. We characterized mutational signatures that were consistent with those reported before in independent investigations. Our work demonstrates that selected mutational signatures correlated with specific clinical and molecular features across different cancer types, and revealed complementarity of specific mutational patterns that has not previously been identified.

			"abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease. Numerous chemotherapeutic agents are available for early stage or advanced/metastatic breast cancer to provide maximum benefit with minimum side effects. However, the clinical outcome of patients with the same clinical and pathological characteristics and treated with similar treatments may show major differences and a vast majority of patients still develop treatment resistance and eventually succumb to disease. It remains an unmet need to identify specific molecular defects, new biomarkers to enable clinicians to adopt individualized treatment for every patient in terms of endocrine, chemotherapy or targeted therapy which will improve clinical outcomes in BC. Our study aimed to identify frequent hotspot mutation profile in BC by targeted deep sequencing in cancer-related genes using Illumina Truseq amplicon/Swift Accel-Amplicon panel and MiSeq technology in an IRB-approved prospective study in a CLIA compliant laboratory. All the cases had pathology review for stage, histological type, hormonal status and Ki-67. Data was processed using Strand NGS\u2122. Mutations identified in the tumor were assessed for 'actionability' i.e. response to therapy and impact on prognosis.",

			"abstract": "The identification of profiled cancer-related genes plays an essential role in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Based on literature research, the classification of genetic mutations continues to be done manually nowadays. Manual classification of genetic mutations is pathologist-dependent, subjective, and time-consuming. To improve the accuracy of clinical interpretation, scientists have proposed computational-based approaches for automatic analysis of mutations with the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies. Nevertheless, some challenges, such as multiple classifications, the complexity of texts, redundant descriptions, and inconsistent interpretation, have limited the development of algorithms. To overcome these difficulties, we have adapted a deep learning method named Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to classify genetic mutations based on text evidence from an annotated database. During the training, three challenging features such as the extreme length of texts, biased data presentation, and high repeatability were addressed. Finally, the BERT+abstract demonstrates satisfactory results with 0.80 logarithmic loss, 0.6837 recall, and 0.705 ",

With the application of protocols to generate organoids from cancer tissue, organoid technology has opened up new opportunities for cancer research and therapy. Using organoid cultures derived from healthy tissues, different aspects of tumour initiation and progression are widely studied including the role of pathogens or specific cancer genes. Cancer organoid cultures, on the other hand, are applied to generate biobanks, perform drug screens, and study mutational signatures. With the incorporation of cellular components of the tumour microenvironment such as immune cells into the organoid cultures, the technology is now also exploited in the rapidly advancing field of immuno-oncology. In this review, I discuss how organoid technology is currently being utilised in cancer research and what obstacles are still to be overcome for its broader use in anti-cancer therapy.",

Computational deconvolution of somatic mutation patterns and expert curation pan-cancer studies have identified a number of mutational signatures associated with point mutations, dinucleotide substitutions, insertions and deletions, and rearrangements,\u00a0and have established etiologies for a subset of these signatures. However, the mechanisms underlying nearly one-third of all mutational signatures are not yet understood. The signatures with established etiology and those with hitherto unknown origin appear to have some differences in strand bias, GC content and nucleotide context diversity. It is possible that some of the hitherto 'unknown' signatures predominantly occur outside gene regions. While nucleotide contexts might be adequate to establish etiologies of some mutational signatures, in other cases additional features, such as broader (epi)genomic contexts, including chromatin, replication timing, processivity and local mutational patterns, may help fully understand the underlying DNA damage and repair processes.\u00a0Nonetheless, remarkable progress in characterization of mutational signatures has provided fundamental insights into the biology of cancer, informed disease etiology and opened up new opportunities for cancer prevention, risk management, and therapeutic decision making.",

The DM are assumed to be deleterious in species evolution, being eliminated by purifying selection unless compensated by other mutations. We present deep phylogenies for 84 cancer driver genes and investigate the prevalence of 434 DM across gene-species trees. The DM are rare in species evolution, and 181 are completely absent, validating their negative fitness effect. The DM are more common in unicellular than in multicellular eukaryotes, suggesting a link between these mutations and cell proliferation control. 18 DM appear as the ancestral state in one or more major clades, including 3 among mammals. We identify within-gene, compensatory mutations for 98 DM and infer likely interactions between the DM and compensatory sites in protein structures. These findings elucidate the evolutionary status of DM and are expected to advance the understanding of the functions and evolution of oncogenes and tumor suppressors.",

Herein, a pH-triggered charge and size dual switchable nanocage co-loaded with abemaciclib and IMD-0354 (PA/PI-ND) is reported, exhibiting a novel triple-interlocked combination of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and chemoimmunotherapy. The charge reversal polymer NGR-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(l-lysine)-dimethylmaleic anhydride (NGR-PEG-PLL-DMA, ND) in PA/PI-ND promotes the pH-triggered charge reversal from negative to positive and size reduction from about 180 to 10\u00a0nm in an acidic tumor microenvironment, which greatly enhances cellular uptake and tumor tissue deep penetration. With the PA/PI-ND triple-interlocked combination therapy, the chemotherapeutic effect is enhanced by the action of abemaciclib to induce cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, together with the reduction in cyclin D levels caused by IMD-0354. The dual anti-tumor promoting immunotherapy is achieved by abemaciclib selectively inhibiting the proliferation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and by IMD-0354 promoting tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) repolarization from an M2 to M1 phenotype. Furthermore, PA/PI-ND has improved anti-tumor efficiency resulting from the third synergistic effect provided by chemoimmunotherapy. Taken together, PA/PI-ND is a promising strategy to guide the design of future drug delivery carriers and cancer combination therapy.",

			"abstract": "Mutation signatures are defined as the distribution of specific mutations such as activity of AID/APOBEC family proteins. Previous studies have reported numerous signatures, using matrix factorization methods for mutation catalogs. Different mutation signatures are active in different tumor types; hence, signature activity varies greatly among tumor types and becomes sparse. Because of this, many previous methods require dividing mutation catalogs for each tumor type. Here, we propose parallelized latent Dirichlet allocation (PLDA), a novel Bayesian model to simultaneously predict mutation signatures with all mutation catalogs. PLDA is an extended model of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), which is one of the methods used for signature prediction. It has parallelized hyperparameters of Dirichlet distributions for LDA, and they represent the sparsity of signature activities for each tumor type, thus facilitating simultaneous analyses. First, we conducted a simulation experiment to compare PLDA with previous methods (including SigProfiler and SignatureAnalyzer) using artificial data and confirmed that PLDA could predict signature structures as accurately as previous methods without searching for the optimal hyperparameters. Next, we applied PLDA to PCAWG (Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes) mutation catalogs and obtained a signature set different from the one predicted by SigProfiler. Further, we have shown that the mutation spectrum represented by the predicted signature with PLDA provides a novel interpretability through post-analyses.",

Advances in DNA sequencing technology and knowledge of events underlying cancer development have created an opportunity for progress in this area. The long-term goal of this work is to develop variation in cancer driver mutation (CDM) levels as a metric of clonal expansion of cells carrying CDMs because these important early events could inform carcinogenicity testing. The first step toward this goal was to develop and validate an error-corrected next-generation sequencing method to analyze panels of hotspot cancer driver mutations (hCDMs). The \"CarcSeq\" method that was developed uses unique molecular identifier sequences to construct single-strand consensus sequences for error correction. CarcSeq was used for mutational analysis of 13 amplicons encompassing >20 hotspot CDMs in normal breast, normal lung, ductal carcinomas, and lung adenocarcinomas. The approach was validated by detecting expected differences related to tissue type (normal vs. tumor and breast vs. lung) and mutation spectra. CarcSeq mutant fractions (MFs) correlated strongly with previously obtained ACB-PCR mutant fraction (MF) measurements from the same samples. A reconstruction experiment, in conjunction with other analyses, showed CarcSeq accurately quantifies MFs \u226510",

			"abstract": "Cells adjust their metabolism in response to mutations, but how this reprogramming depends on the genetic context is not well known. Specifically, the absence of individual enzymes can affect reprogramming, and thus the impact of mutations in cell growth. Here, we examine this issue with an in silico model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae's metabolism. By quantifying the variability in the growth rate of 10000 different mutant metabolisms that accumulated changes in their reaction fluxes, in the presence, or absence, of a specific enzyme, we distinguish a subset of modifier genes serving as buffers or potentiators of variability. We notice that the most potent modifiers refer to the glycolysis pathway and that, more broadly, they show strong pleiotropy and epistasis. Moreover, the evidence that this subset depends on the specific growing condition strengthens its systemic underpinning, a feature only observed before in a toy model of a gene-regulatory network. Some of these enzymes also modulate the effect that biochemical noise and environmental fluctuations produce in growth. Thus, the reorganization of metabolism induced by mutations has not only direct physiological implications but also transforms the influence that other mutations have on growth. This is a general result with implications in the development of cancer therapies based on metabolic inhibitors.",

			"abstract": "The incidence of penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) has increased in developed countries over the past decades owing to increased human papilloma virus (HPV) exposure. Despite successful surgical treatment of locoregional PSCC, effective treatment options for advanced disease are limited. The prognosis of patients with bulky nodal and metastatic PSCC is dismal and new management approaches are urgently needed. Genomic analyses have provided transformative knowledge on the genomic and molecular landscape and tumour microenvironment of PSCC. Around one-quarter of patients with metastatic PSCC have clinically actionable genomic alterations in mechanistic target of rapamycin, DNA repair and receptor tyrosine kinase pathways. These patients might benefit from combined and sequential targeted therapies. HPV vaccination might be another therapeutic option as PSCC is genetically similar to\u00a0other HPV-driven cancers. In addition, 40-60% of PSCC tumours show strong PDL1 expression, and the frequency of mutational signatures suggestive of immunotherapy resistance is low, pointing to potential utility of immunotherapy for PSCC. Finally, identification of the composition of the penile microbiota and its biological role might lead to new cancer prevention and treatment strategies.",

			"abstract": "A fundamental goal in cancer research is to understand the mechanisms of cell transformation. This is key to developing more efficient cancer detection methods and therapeutic approaches. One milestone towards this objective is the identification of all the genes with mutations capable of driving tumours. Since the 1970s, the list of cancer genes has been growing steadily. Because cancer driver genes are under positive selection in tumorigenesis, their observed patterns of somatic mutations across tumours in a cohort deviate from those expected from neutral mutagenesis. These deviations, which constitute signals of positive selection, may be detected by carefully designed bioinformatics methods, which have become the state of the art in the identification of driver genes. A systematic approach combining several of these signals could lead to a compendium of mutational cancer genes. In this Review, we present the Integrative OncoGenomics (IntOGen) pipeline, an implementation of such an approach to obtain the compendium of mutational cancer drivers. Its application to somatic mutations of more than 28,000 tumours of 66 cancer types reveals 568 cancer genes and points towards their mechanisms of tumorigenesis. The application of this approach to the ever-growing datasets of somatic tumour mutations will support the continuous refinement of our knowledge of the genetic basis of cancer.",

			"abstract": "Some random mutations can confer a selective advantage to a hematopoietic stem cell. As a result, mutated hematopoietic stem cells can give rise to a significant proportion of mutated clones of blood cells. This event is known as \"clonal hematopoiesis.\" Clonal hematopoiesis is closely associated with age, and carriers show an increased risk of developing blood cancers. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential is defined by the presence of clones carrying a mutation associated with a blood neoplasm without obvious hematological malignancies. Unexpectedly, in recent years, it has emerged that clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential carriers also have an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Mechanisms linking clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential to cardiovascular disease are only partially known. Findings in animal models indicate that clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential-related mutations amplify inflammatory responses. Consistently, clinical studies have revealed that clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential carriers display increased levels of inflammatory markers. In this review, we describe progress in our understanding of clonal hematopoiesis in the context of cancer, and we discuss the most recent findings linking clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential and cardiovascular diseases.",

			"abstract": "Although a majority of somatic mutations in cancer are passengers, their mutational signatures provide mechanistic insights into mutagenesis and DNA repair processes. Mutational signature SBS8 is common in most cancers, but its etiology is debated. Incorporating genomic, epigenomic, and cellular process features for multiple cell-types we develop genome-wide composite epigenomic context-maps relevant for mutagenesis and DNA repair. Analyzing somatic mutation data from multiple cancer types in their epigenomic contexts, we show that SBS8 preferentially occurs in gene-poor, lamina-proximal, late replicating heterochromatin domains. While SBS8 is uncommon among mutations in non-malignant tissues, in tumor genomes its proportions increase with replication timing and speed, and checkpoint defects further promote this signature - suggesting that SBS8 probably arises due to uncorrected late replication errors during cancer progression. Our observations offer a potential reconciliation among different perspectives in the debate about the etiology of SBS8 and its relationship with other mutational signatures.",

These methods have also been used to predict gene mutations from pathology images, but no comprehensive evaluation of their potential for extracting molecular features from histology slides has yet been performed. We show that HE2RNA, a model based on the integration of multiple data modes, can be trained to systematically predict RNA-Seq profiles from whole-slide images alone, without expert annotation. Through its interpretable design, HE2RNA provides virtual spatialization of gene expression, as validated by CD3- and CD20-staining on an independent dataset. The transcriptomic representation learned by HE2RNA can also be transferred on other datasets, even of small size, to increase prediction performance for specific molecular phenotypes. We illustrate the use of this approach in clinical diagnosis purposes such as the identification of tumors with microsatellite instability.",

			"abstract": "Children show a higher incidence of leukemia compared to young adolescents, yet their cells have less age-related (oncogenic) somatic mutations. Newborns with Down syndrome have an even higher risk of developing leukemia, which is thought to be driven by mutations that accumulate during fetal development. To characterize mutation accumulation in individual stem and progenitor cells of Down syndrome and karyotypically normal fetuses, we clonally expanded single cells and performed whole-genome sequencing. We found a higher mutation rate in haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells during fetal development compared to the post-infant rate. In fetal trisomy 21 cells the number of somatic mutations is even further increased, which was already apparent during the first cell divisions of embryogenesis before gastrulation. The number and types of mutations in fetal trisomy 21 haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells were similar to those in Down syndrome-associated myeloid preleukemia and could be attributed to mutational processes that were active during normal fetal haematopoiesis. Finally, we found that the contribution of early embryonic cells to human fetal tissues can vary considerably between individuals. The increased mutation rates found in this study, may contribute to the increased risk of leukemia early during life and the higher incidence of leukemia in Down syndrome.",

We used the magnetic labelling and cell-sorting approach to track the expression of therapeutic protein targets in CTCs isolated from blood samples of mice with orthotopic prostate xenografts and from patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We also show that mutated proteins that are drug targets or markers of therapeutic response can be directly identified in CTCs, analysed at the single-cell level and used to predict how mice with drug-susceptible and drug-resistant pancreatic tumour xenografts respond to therapy.",

			"abstract": "Cancer is a complex disease in which both genetic defects and microenvironmental components contribute to the development, progression, and metastasization of disease, representing major hurdles in the identification of more effective and safer treatment regimens for patients. Three-dimensional (3D) models are changing the paradigm of preclinical cancer research as they more closely resemble the complex tissue environment and architecture found in clinical tumors than in bidimensional (2D) cell cultures. Among 3D models, spheroids and organoids represent the most versatile and promising models in that they are capable of recapitulating the heterogeneity and pathophysiology of human cancers and of filling the gap between conventional 2D in vitro testing and animal models. Such 3D systems represent a powerful tool for studying cancer biology, enabling us to model the dynamic evolution of neoplastic disease from the early stages to metastatic dissemination and the interactions with the microenvironment. Spheroids and organoids have recently been used in the field of drug discovery and personalized medicine. The combined use of 3D models could potentially improve the robustness and reliability of preclinical research data, reducing the need for animal testing and favoring their transition to clinical practice. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the use of these 3D systems for cancer modeling, focusing on their innovative translational applications, looking at future challenges, and comparing them with most widely used animal models.",

Such interactions are inherently multivariate, spanning multiple time and size scales, cell types, and organ systems, rendering systems biology approaches particularly amenable to their interrogation. While in its infancy, the field of 'Cancer Systems Immunology' has already influenced our understanding of tumor immunology and immunotherapy.

This study aimed to identify the prognostic hub genes, which are the central modulators to regulate the progression and proliferation in the specific subtype of bladder cancer. The identification of the candidate hub gene was performed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis to construct a free-scale gene co-expression network. The gene expression profile of GSE97768 from the Gene Expression Omnibus database was used. The association between prognosis and hub gene was evaluated by The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Four gene-expression modules were significantly related to bladder cancer disease: the red module (human adenocarcinoma lymph node metastasis), the darkturquioise module (grade 2 carcinoma), the lightgreen module (grade 3 carcinoma), and the royalblue module (transitional cell carcinoma lymphatic metastasis). Based on betweenness centrality and survival analysis, we identified laminin subunit gamma-2 (LAMC2) in the grade 2 carcinoma, gelsolin (GSN) in the grade 3 carcinoma, and homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) in the transitional cell carcinoma lymphatic metastasis. Subsequently, the protein levels of LAMC2 and GSN were respectively down-regulated and up-regulated in tumor tissue with the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database. Our results suggested that LAMC2 and GSN are the central modulators to transfer information in the specific subtype of the disease.",

Examples of biologic data include biobanks; biometric data may have individual wellness data from devices; electronic health data include the medical record; and other data demographics and images. Big data has also contributed to the changes in the research methodology. Changes in the clinical research paradigm has been fueled by large-scale biological data harvesting (biobanks), which is developed, analyzed, and managed by cheaper computing technology (big data), supported by greater flexibility in study design (real-world data) and the relationships between industry, government regulators, and academics. Cultural changes along with easy access to information via the Internet facilitate ease of participation by more people. Current needs demand quick answers which may be supplied by big data, biobanks, and changes in flexibility in study design. Big data can reveal health patterns, and promises to provide solutions that have previously been out of society's grasp; however, the murkiness of international laws, questions of data ownership, public ignorance, and privacy and security concerns are slowing down the progress that could otherwise be achieved by the use of big data.

Several types of immunotherapy, including adoptive cell transfer (ACT) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), have obtained durable clinical responses, but their efficacies vary, and only subsets of cancer patients can benefit from them. Immune infiltrates in the tumor microenvironment (TME) have been shown to play a key role in tumor development and will affect the clinical outcomes of cancer patients. Comprehensive profiling of tumor-infiltrating immune cells would shed light on the mechanisms of cancer-immune evasion, thus providing opportunities for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. However, the highly heterogeneous and dynamic nature of the TME impedes the precise dissection of intratumoral immune cells. With recent advances in single-cell technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and mass cytometry, systematic interrogation of the TME is feasible and will provide insights into the functional diversities of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. In this review, we outline the recent progress in cancer immunotherapy, particularly by focusing on landmark studies and the recent single-cell characterization of tumor-associated immune cells, and we summarize the phenotypic diversities of intratumoral immune cells and their connections with cancer immunotherapy. We believe such a review could strengthen our understanding of the progress in cancer immunotherapy, facilitate the elucidation of immune cell modulation in tumor progression, and thus guide the development of novel immunotherapies for cancer treatment.",

			"abstract": "The landscape of cancer treatment has improved over the past decades, aiming to reduce systemic toxicity and enhance compatibility with the quality of life of the patient. However, at the therapeutic level, metastatic cancer remains hugely challenging, based on the almost inevitable emergence of therapy resistance. A small subpopulation of cells able to survive drug treatment termed the minimal residual disease may either harbor resistance-associated mutations or be phenotypically resistant, allowing them to regrow and become the dominant population in the therapy-resistant tumor. Characterization of the profile of minimal residual disease represents the key to the identification of resistance drivers that underpin cancer evolution. Therapeutic regimens must, therefore, be dynamic and tailored to take into account the emergence of resistance as tumors evolve within a complex microenvironment in vivo. This requires the adoption of new technologies based on the culture of cancer cells in ways that more accurately reflect the intratumor microenvironment, and their analysis using omics and system-based technologies to enable a new era in the diagnostics, classification, and treatment of many cancer types by applying the concept \"from the cell plate to the patient.\" In this chapter, we will present and discuss 3D model building and use, and provide comprehensive information on new genomic techniques that are increasing our understanding of drug action and the emergence of resistance.",

			"abstract": "Cancer is caused by genetic alterations that affect cellular fitness, and multicellular organisms have evolved mechanisms to suppress cancer such as cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis. These pathways may be enhanced by the addition of tumor suppressor gene paralogs or deletion of oncogenes. To provide insights to the evolution of cancer suppression across the mammalian radiation, we estimated copy numbers for 548 human tumor suppressor gene and oncogene homologs in 63 mammalian genome assemblies. The naked mole rat contained the most cancer gene copies, consistent with the extremely low rates of cancer found in this species. We found a positive correlation between a species' cancer gene copy number and its longevity, but not body size, contrary to predictions from Peto's Paradox. Extremely long-lived mammals also contained more copies of caretaker genes in their genomes, suggesting that the maintenance of genome integrity is an essential form of cancer prevention in long-lived species. We found the strongest association between longevity and copy numbers of genes that are both germline and somatic tumor suppressor genes, suggesting that selection has acted to suppress both hereditary and sporadic cancers. We also found a strong relationship between the number of tumor suppressor genes and the number of oncogenes in mammalian genomes, suggesting that complex regulatory networks mediate the balance between cell proliferation and checks on tumor progression. This study is the first to investigate cancer gene expansions across the mammalian radiation and provides a springboard for potential human therapies based on evolutionary medicine.",

			"abstract": "Identifying driver genes that contribute to cancer progression from numerous passenger genes, although a central goal, is a major challenge. The protein-protein interaction network provides convenient and reasonable assistance for driver gene discovery. Random walk-based methods have been widely used to prioritize nodes in social or biological networks. However, most studies select the next arriving node uniformly from the random walker's neighbors. Few consider transiting preference according to the degree of random walker's neighbors. In this study, based on the random walk method, we propose a novel approach named Driver_IRW (Driver genes discovery with Improved Random Walk method), to prioritize cancer genes in cancer-related network. The key idea of Driver_IRW is to assign different transition probabilities for different edges of a constructed cancer-related network in accordance with the degree of the nodes' neighbors. Furthermore, the global centrality (here is betweenness centrality) and Katz feedback centrality are incorporated into the framework to evaluate the probability to walk to the seed nodes. Experimental results on four cancer types indicate that Driver_IRW performs more efficiently than some previously published methods for uncovering known cancer-related genes. In conclusion, our method can aid in prioritizing cancer-related genes and complement traditional frequency and network-based methods.",

			"abstract": "Knowledge about established breast carcinogens can support improved and modernized toxicological testing methods by identifying key mechanistic events. Ionizing radiation (IR) increases the risk of breast cancer, especially for women and for exposure at younger ages, and evidence overall supports a linear dose-response relationship. We used the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP)\u00a0framework to outline and evaluate the evidence linking ionizing radiation with breast cancer from molecular initiating events to the adverse outcome through intermediate key events, creating a qualitative AOP. We identified key events based on review articles, searched PubMed for recent literature on key events and IR, and identified additional papers using references. We manually curated publications and evaluated data quality. Ionizing radiation directly and indirectly causes DNA damage and increases production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). RONS lead to DNA damage and epigenetic changes leading to mutations and genomic instability (GI). Proliferation amplifies the effects of DNA damage and mutations leading to the AO of breast cancer. Separately, RONS and DNA damage also increase inflammation. Inflammation contributes to direct and indirect effects (effects in cells not directly reached by IR) via positive feedback to RONS and DNA damage, and separately increases proliferation and breast cancer through pro-carcinogenic effects on cells and tissue. For example, gene expression changes alter inflammatory mediators, resulting in improved survival and growth of cancer cells and a more hospitable tissue environment. All of these events overlap at multiple points with events characteristic of \"background\" induction of breast carcinogenesis, including hormone-responsive proliferation, oxidative activity, and DNA damage. These overlaps make the breast particularly susceptible to ionizing radiation and reinforce that these biological activities are important characteristics of carcinogens. Agents that increase these biological processes should be considered potential breast carcinogens, and predictive methods are needed to identify chemicals that increase these processes. Techniques are available to measure RONS, DNA damage and mutation, cell proliferation, and some inflammatory proteins or processes. Improved assays are needed to measure GI and chronic inflammation, as well as the interaction with hormonally driven development and proliferation. Several methods measure diverse epigenetic changes, but it is not clear which changes are relevant to breast cancer. In addition, most toxicological assays are not conducted in mammary tissue, and so it is a priority to evaluate if results from other tissues are generalizable to breast, or to conduct assays in breast tissue. Developing and applying these assays to identify exposures of concern will facilitate efforts to reduce subsequent breast cancer risk.",

			"abstract": "Before the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for a particular subgroup of patients, despite platinum-based combination chemotherapy, the majority of patients affected by non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) did not live longer than one year. With deeper understanding of tumor molecular biology, treatment of NSCLC has progressively entered the era of treatment customization according to tumor molecular characteristics, as well as histology. All this information allowed the development of personalized molecular targeted therapies. A series of studies have shown that, in some cases, cancer cells can grow and survive as result of the presence of a single driver genomic abnormality. This phenomenon, called oncogene-addiction, more often occurs in adenocarcinoma histology, in non-smokers (except BRAF mutations, also frequent in smoking patients), young, and female patients. Several different driver mutations have been identified and many studies have clearly shown that upfront TKI monotherapy may improve the overall outcome of these patients. The greater efficacy of these drugs is also associated with a better tolerability and safety than chemotherapy, with fewer side effects and an extremely good compliance to treatment. The most frequent oncogene-addicted disease is represented by those tumors carrying a mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The development of first, second and third generation TKIs against EGFR mutations have dramatically changed the prognosis of these patients. Currently, osimertinib (which demonstrated to improve efficacy with a better tolerability in comparison with first-generation TKIs) is considered the best treatment option for patients affected by NSCLC harboring a common EGFR mutation. EML4-ALK-driven disease (which gene re-arrangement occurs in 3-7% of NSCLC), has demonstrated to be significantly targeted by specific TKIs, which have improved outcome in comparison with chemotherapy. To date, alectinib is considered the best treatment option for these patients, with other newer agents upcoming. Other additional driver abnormalities, such as ROS1, BRAF, MET, RET and NTRK, have been identified as a target mirroring peculiar vulnerability to specific agents. Oncogene-addicted disease typically has a low early resistance rate, but late acquired resistance always develops and therefore therapy needs to be changed when progression occurs. In this narrative review, the state of art of scientific literature about targeted therapy options in oncogene-addicted disease is summarized and critically discussed. We also aim to analyze future perspectives to maximize benefits for this subgroup of patients.",

Discrimination could, therefore, be influenced by the distinction of germline versus somatic, rather than neutral versus disease driver. This motivates this article in which we consider predictive discrimination between recurrent and rare somatic single point mutations based solely on using cancer data, and the distinction between these two somatic classes and germline single point mutations.",

			"abstract": "Prostate cancer (PC) is the most prevalent cancer in men and the second main cause of cancer-related death in Western society. The lack of proper PC models that recapitulate the molecular and genomic landscape of clinical disease has hampered progress toward translational research to understand the disease initiation, progression, and therapeutic responses in each patient. Although several models have been developed, they hardly emulated the complicated PC microenvironment. Precision medicine is an emerging approach predicting appropriate therapies for individual cancer patients by means of various analyses of individual genomic profiling and targeting specific cancer pathways. In PC, precision medicine also has the potential to impose changes in clinical practices. Here, we describe the various PC models with special focus on PC organoids and their values in basic medicine, personalized therapy, and translational researches in vitro and in vivo, which could help to achieve the full transformative power of cancer precision medicine.",

			"abstract": "Growing evidence highlighted the tumor mutational burden (TMB) as an important feature of carcinogenesis and therapeutic efficacy in esophageal cancer (EC). Our study aimed to explore the genomic landscape and the correlation between TMB and immune cell infiltration in EC patients with or without radiotherapy. The EC patients were categorized into high TMB (TMB-H) and low TMB (TMB-L) groups by the ESTIMATE algorithm, and subgroup analysis was performed based on receiving radiotherapy or not. Univariate regression analysis indicated TMB and TNM stages as high-risk prognostic factors (Hazard ratio > 1 and P < 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis suggested TMB as an independent prognostic factor (Hazard ratio = 1.051, P = 0.003). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed no significant difference of the overall survival (OS) between TMB-H and TMB-L groups (P = 0.082). However, EC patients without radiotherapy in the TMB-H group had significantly decreased OS (P = 0.038) and increased Tregs cell infiltration (P = 0.033). These results suggested TMB as a prognostic marker for EC patients. Especially for patients who did not receive radiotherapy, the prognosis of TMB-H patients was significantly poorer than that of TMB-L patients, which might result from the different regulatory T cell infiltration.",

			"abstract": "Prolonged cell survival occurs through the expression of specific protein isoforms generated by alternate splicing of mRNA precursors in cancer cells. How alternate splicing regulates tumor development and resistance to targeted therapies in cancer remain poorly understood. Here we show that RNF113A, whose loss-of-function causes the X-linked trichothiodystrophy, is overexpressed in lung cancer and protects from Cisplatin-dependent cell death. RNF113A is a RNA-binding protein which regulates the splicing of multiple candidates involved in cell survival. RNF113A deficiency triggers cell death upon DNA damage through multiple mechanisms, including apoptosis via the destabilization of the prosurvival protein MCL-1, ferroptosis due to enhanced SAT1 expression, and increased production of ROS due to altered Noxa1 expression. RNF113A deficiency circumvents the resistance to Cisplatin and to BCL-2 inhibitors through the destabilization of MCL-1, which thus defines spliceosome inhibitors as a therapeutic approach to treat tumors showing acquired resistance to specific drugs due to MCL-1 stabilization.",

In this review, we describe how whole genome sequencing is emerging as a key technology to decipher this complexity at every stage of myeloma development: precursors, diagnosis and relapsed/refractory. Defining the time windows when driver events are acquired improves our understanding of cancer etiology and paves the way for early diagnosis and ultimately prevention.",

Here, as part of the ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium, which aggregated whole genome sequencing data from 2658 cancers across 38 tumour types, we describe DriverPower, a software package that uses mutational burden and functional impact evidence to identify driver mutations in coding and non-coding sites within cancer whole genomes. Using a total of 1373 genomic features derived from public sources, DriverPower's background mutation model explains up to 93% of the regional variance in the mutation rate across multiple tumour types. By incorporating functional impact scores, we are able to further increase the accuracy of driver discovery. Testing across a collection of 2583 cancer genomes from the PCAWG project, DriverPower identifies 217 coding and 95 non-coding driver candidates. Comparing to six published methods used by the PCAWG Drivers and Functional Interpretation Working Group, DriverPower has the highest F1 score for both coding and non-coding driver discovery. This demonstrates that DriverPower is an effective framework for computational driver discovery.",

In the study, we analyzed the information regarding somatic mutation obtained by whole-exome sequencing in 280 HBV-related HCC tissues from public databases and published studies. Via integrative analysis, 78 genes, including TP53, TTN, MUC16, CTNNB1, and PCLO were summarized as highly mutated genes, and some of these mutated genes were further identified as cancer driver genes. Besides, we discovered that the highly mutated genes were enriched with various biological functions and pathways. The expression of many of highly mutated genes was found to be significantly altered in HBV-related HCC, and several highly mutated genes were related to a variety of clinical factors and associated with the poor survival of the disease. Taken together, these results could enrich our understanding of highly mutated genes and their relationships with HBV-related HCC. Some of the identified highly mutated genes might be used as novel biomarkers of disease prognosis, or as molecular targets for the treatment of HCC with HBV infection.",

			"abstract": "Produced water is the largest waste stream associated with oil and gas operations. This complex fluid contains petroleum hydrocarbons, heavy metals, salts, naturally occurring radioactive materials and any remaining chemical additives. In the United States, west of the 98th meridian, the federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) exemption allows release of produced water for agricultural beneficial reuse. The goal of this study was to quantify mutagenicity of a produced water NPDES release and discharge stream. We used four mutation assays in budding yeast cells that provide rate estimates for copy number variation (CNV) duplications and deletions, as well as forward and reversion point mutations. Higher mutation rates were observed at the discharge and decreased with distance downstream, which correlated with the concentrations of known carcinogens detected in the stream (e.g., benzene, radium), described in a companion study. Mutation rate increases were most prominent for CNV duplications and were higher than mutations observed in mixtures of known toxic compounds. Additionally, the samples were evaluated for acute toxicity in Daphnia magna and developmental toxicity in zebrafish. Acute toxicity was minimal, and no developmental toxicity was observed. This study illustrates that chemical analysis alone (McLaughlin et al., 2020) is insufficient for characterizing the risk of produced water NPDES releases and that a thorough evaluation of chronic toxicity is necessary to fully assess produced water for beneficial reuse.",

However, most approaches for studying copy-number variation rely upon uniquely mapping reads to a genome reference and are unable to distinguish among duplicated sequences. Specialized approaches to interrogate specific paralogs are comparatively slow and have a high degree of computational complexity, limiting their effective application to emerging population-scale data sets. We present QuicK-mer2, a self-contained, mapping-free approach that enables the rapid construction of paralog-specific copy-number maps from short-read sequence data. This approach is based on the tabulation of unique k-mer sequences from short-read data sets, and is able to analyze a 20X coverage human genome in approximately 20 min. We applied our approach to newly released sequence data from the 1000 Genomes Project, constructed paralog-specific copy-number maps from 2457 unrelated individuals, and uncovered copy-number variation of paralogous genes. We identify nine genes where none of the analyzed samples have a copy number of two, 92 genes where the majority of samples have a copy number other than two, and describe rare copy number variation effecting multiple genes at the APOBEC3 locus.",

Cell morphology is an emergent readout of the molecular underpinnings of a cell's functions and, thus, can be used as a method to define the functional state of an individual cell. We measured 216 features derived from cell and nucleus morphology for more than 30,000 breast cancer cells. We find that single cell-derived clones (SCCs) established from the same parental cells exhibit distinct and heritable morphological traits associated with genomic (ploidy) and transcriptomic phenotypes. Using unsupervised clustering analysis, we find that the morphological classes of SCCs predict distinct tumorigenic and metastatic potentials in vivo using multiple mouse models of breast cancer. These findings lay the groundwork for using quantitative morpho-profiling in vitro as a potentially convenient and economical method for phenotyping function in cancer in vivo.",

T cell repertoire attributes are associated with clinicopathologic features, mutational and immune landscape. A considerable proportion of the most prevalent T cells in tumors are also prevalent in the uninvolved tumor-adjacent lungs and appear specific to shared background mutations or viral infections. Patients with higher T cell repertoire homology between the tumor and uninvolved tumor-adjacent lung, suggesting a less tumor-focused T cell response, exhibit inferior survival. These findings indicate that a concise understanding of antigens and T cells in NSCLC is needed to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce toxicity with immunotherapy, particularly adoptive T cell therapy.",

The related data were derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and then analyzed by weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA). The correlation between each module and the clinical traits were analyzed by Pearson's correlation analysis. Pathway analysis was conducted to reveal potential mechanisms. Hub genes within each module were screened by intramodule analysis, and visualized by Cytoscape software. Furthermore, important hub genes were validated in an external dataset and clinical samples. A total of 5,839 differentially expressed genes were identified. By using WGCNA, we identified 21 coregulatory gene clusters based on 289 PRCC samples. We found many modules were significantly associated with clinicopathological characteristics. The gray, pink, light yellow, and salmon modules served as prognosis indicators for PRCC patients. Pathway enrichment analyses found that the hub genes were significantly enriched in the cancer-related pathways. With the external Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) validation dataset, we found that PCDH12, GPR4, and KIF18A in the pink and yellow modules were continually associated with the survival status of PRCC, and their expressions were positively correlated with pathological grade. Notably, we randomly chose PCDH12 for validation, and the results suggested that the PRCC patients with higher pathological grades (II\u2009+\u2009III) mostly had higher PCDH12 protein expression levels compared with those patients in grade I. These validated hub genes play critical roles in the prognosis prediction of PRCC and serve as potential biomarkers for future personalized treatment.",

			"abstract": "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common histologic subtype of lung cancer. Previous research has shown heterogeneity in lung cancer, with the parallel existence of multiple subclones characterized by their own specific mutational landscape. The aim of our study was to gain insight into the evolutionary pattern of lung cancer by investigating the genomic heterogeneity between a nodule and its distant tumor. Luckily, we obtained nodule and tumor samples derived from surgery and a blood sample from a single patient. The samples are very unique, for tissues with the same genetic background from nodules to malignant tumors are rarely available and require precise micro-cutting. In this study, we performed whole-genome sequencing of these two samples, to identify novel candidate driver genes associated with LUAD. The nodule and tumor were found to have common significant ubiquitin-specific protease 40 (USP40) mutations, indicating an important driver role for the gene. Moreover, we also observed the two novel candidate driver genes ASCL5 and CAPNS1 in the LUAD sample. In summary, we pinpoint the predominant mutations in LUAD by WES, highlighting the substantial genetic alterations contributing to LUAD tumorigenesis. This may provide a better understanding of the clonal evolution during tumor development.",

			"abstract": "Tumor DNA sequencing data can be interpreted by computational methods that analyze genomic heterogeneity to infer evolutionary dynamics. A growing number of studies have used these approaches to link cancer evolution with clinical progression and response to therapy. Although the inference of tumor phylogenies is rapidly becoming standard practice in cancer genome analyses, standards for evaluating them are lacking. To address this need, we systematically assess methods for reconstructing tumor subclonality. First, we elucidate the main algorithmic problems in subclonal reconstruction and develop quantitative metrics for evaluating them. Then we simulate realistic tumor genomes that harbor all known clonal and subclonal mutation types and processes. Finally, we benchmark 580 tumor reconstructions, varying tumor read depth, tumor type and somatic variant detection. Our analysis provides a baseline for the establishment of gold-standard methods to analyze tumor heterogeneity.",

Patients with TNBC tend to have a higher risk for early relapse and a worse prognosis. TNBC is characterized by extensive somatic copy number alterations (CNAs). However, the DNA CNA profile of TNBC remains to be extensively investigated. The present study assessed the genomic profile of CNAs in 201\u00a0TNBC samples, aiming to identify recurrent CNAs that may drive the pathogenesis of TNBC. In total, 123\u00a0regions of significant amplification and deletion were detected using the Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer algorithm, and potential driver genes for TNBC were identified. A total of 31\u00a0samples exhibited signs of chromothripsis and revealed chromosome pulverization hotspot regions. The present study further determined 199\u00a0genomic locations that were significantly enriched for breakpoints, which indicated TNBC\u2011specific genomic instability regions. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of tumors resulted in three main subgroups that exhibited distinct CNA profiles, which may reveal the heterogeneity of molecular mechanisms in TNBC subgroups. These results will extend the molecular understanding of TNBC and will facilitate the discovery of therapeutic and diagnostic target candidates.",

			"abstract": "Cancer is driven by the sequential accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. The timing of these events is not well understood. Moreover, it is currently unknown why the same driver gene change appears as an early event in some cancer types and as a later event, or not at all, in others. These questions have become even more topical with the recent progress brought by genome-wide sequencing studies of cancer. Focusing on mutational events, we provide a mathematical model of the full process of tumor evolution that includes different types of fitness advantages for driver genes and carrying-capacity considerations. The model is able to recapitulate a substantial proportion of the observed cancer incidence in several cancer types (colorectal, pancreatic, and leukemia) and inherited conditions (Lynch and familial adenomatous polyposis), by changing only 2 tissue-specific parameters: the number of stem cells in a tissue and its cell division frequency. The model sheds light on the evolutionary dynamics of cancer by suggesting a generalized early onset of tumorigenesis followed by slow mutational waves, in contrast to previous conclusions. Formulas and estimates are provided for the fitness increases induced by driver mutations, often much larger than previously described, and highly tissue dependent. Our results suggest a mechanistic explanation for why the selective fitness advantage introduced by specific driver genes is tissue dependent.",

Clinical diagnosis of multiple HCC is usually made based on tumor location and/or time to recurrence; however, it is often difficult to distinguish the two types of multiple HCC. Using 41 matched pairs of multiple HCC specimens, we confirmed the accuracy of clinical diagnoses using exome sequence data and investigated the importance of discriminating the type of multiple HCC. Genomic analysis revealed that 18 (43.9%) patients diagnosed as having genomic IM had common mutations in a pair of HCC tumors with the main tumor of these patients being more progressive compared to those with genomic MO. The accuracy of clinical diagnosis based on lobe (Definition 1) and segment (Definition 2) were 68.3% and 78.0%, respectively. Intriguingly, recurrence \u22652\u00a0years after initial surgery for 3 patients was IM. The survival of patients with clinical IM was significantly shorter than for those with clinical MO based on both Definition 1 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.045) and Definition 2 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.043). However, mean survival was not different between the patients with genomic IM and those with MO (P\u00a0=\u00a00.364). Taken together, genomic analysis elucidated that liver cancer may spread more extensively and more slowly than previously thought. In addition, distinguishing multiple HCC as IM or MC may have provided biological information but was not of clinical importance with respect to patient prognosis.",

			"abstract": "Lung cancer represents a genetically heterogeneous disease with low survival rates. Recent data have evidenced key roles of noncoding RNAs in lung cancer initiation and progression. These functional RNA molecules that can act as both oncogenes and tumor suppressors may become future biomarkers and more efficient therapeutic targets. In the precision medicine era, circulating nucleic acids have the potential to reshape the management and prognosis of cancer patients. Detecting genomic alterations and level variations of circulating nucleic acids in liquid biopsy samples represents a noninvasive method for portraying tumor burden. Research is currently trying to validate the potential role of liquid biopsy in lung cancer screening, prognosis, monitoring of disease progression, and treatment response. However, this method requires complex detection assays, and implementation of plasma genotyping in clinical practice continues to be hindered by discrepancies that arise when compared to tissue genotyping. Understanding the genomic landscape of lung cancer is essential in order to provide useful and innovative research in the age of patient-tailored therapy. In this landscape, the noncoding RNAs play a crucial role due to their target genes that dramatically influence the tumor microenvironment and the response to therapy. This article addresses present and future possible roles of liquid biopsy in lung cancer. It also discusses how the complex role of noncoding RNAs in lung tumorigenesis could influence the management of this pathology.",

Furthermore, analysis of circulating-free DNA (cfDNA) in the so-called \"liquid biopsy\" has emerged as a non-invasive method to identify genomic information to inform targeted therapy and may also capture the heterogeneity of the primary and metastatic tumours. Considering the potential of cfDNA analysis as a translational laboratory tool in clinical practice, establishing the extent to which cfDNA represents the SGAs of tumours, particularly actionable driver alterations, becomes a matter of importance, warranting standardisation of methods and practices. Here, we assess the utilisation of cfDNA for molecular profiling of SGAs in tumour tissue across a broad range of solid tumours.

A number of ready-to-use bioinformatics tools are available to perform both multi-staged and meta-dimensional integration of multi-omics data. In this study, we compared nine different integration tools using real and simulated cancer datasets. The performance of the multi-staged integration tools were assessed at the gene, function and pathway levels, while meta-dimensional integration tools were assessed based on the sample classification performance. Additionally, we discuss the influence of factors such as data representation, sample size, signal and noise on multi-omics data integration.

It is known that the recognition of a peptide-MHC (pMHC) by the T-cell receptor is performed entirely in a structural fashion, where the atomic interactions of both structures, pMHC and TCR, dictate the fate of the process. However, epitopes with a similar composition of amino acids can produce dissimilar surfaces. Conversely, sequences with no conspicuous similarities can exhibit similar TCR interaction surfaces. In the last decade, our group developed a database and in silico structural methods to extract molecular fingerprints that trigger T-cell immune responses, mainly referring to physicochemical similarities, which could explain the immunogenic differences presented by different pMHC-I complexes.

Accurate identification of driver genes and driver mutations is critical for advancing cancer research and personalizing treatment based on accurate stratification of patients. Due to inter-tumor genetic heterogeneity many driver mutations within a gene occur at low frequencies, which make it challenging to distinguish them from non-driver mutations. We have developed a novel method for identifying cancer driver genes. Our approach utilizes multiple complementary types of information, specifically cellular phenotypes, cellular locations, functions, and whole body physiological phenotypes as features. We demonstrate that our method can accurately identify known cancer driver genes and distinguish between their role in different types of cancer. In addition to confirming known driver genes, we identify several novel candidate driver genes. We demonstrate the utility of our method by validating its predictions in nasopharyngeal cancer and colorectal cancer using whole exome and whole genome sequencing.",

The somatic mutation theory suggests that along with inherited ones, the changes in DNA caused by environmental factors may cause cancer. Although approximately 50-60 mutations per tumor are observed in established cancer tissue, it is known that not all of these mutations occur at the beginning of carcinogenesis but also occur later in the disease progression. The high frequency of somatic mutations referring to genomic instability contributes to the intratumoral genetic heterogeneity and treatment resistance. The contribution of the tumor microenvironment to the mutations observed following the acquirement of essential malignant characteristics of a cancer cell is one of the topics that have been extensively investigated in recent years. The frequency of mutations in hematologic tumors is generally less than solid tumors. Although it is a hematologic tumor, multiple myeloma is more similar to solid tumors in terms of the high number of chromosomal abnormalities and genetic heterogeneity. In multiple myeloma, bone marrow microenvironment also plays a role in genomic instability that occurs in the very early stages of the disease. In this review, we will briefly summarize the role of the tumor microenvironment and bone marrow microenvironment in the genomic instability seen in solid tumors and multiple myeloma.",

In spite of the already generated volumes of data, our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying complex genetic diseases remains limited. Increasing evidence shows that biological networks are essential, albeit not sufficient, for the better understanding of these mechanisms. The identification of disease-specific functional modules in the human interactome can provide a more focused insight into the mechanistic nature of the disease. However, carving a disease network module from the whole interactome is a difficult task. In this paper, we propose a computational framework, Discovering most IMpacted SUbnetworks in interactoMe (DIMSUM), which enables the integration of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and functional effects of mutations into the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to improve disease module detection. Specifically, our approach incorporates and propagates the functional impact of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) on PPIs to implicate the genes that are most likely influenced by the disruptive mutations, and to identify the module with the greatest functional impact. Comparison against state-of-the-art seed-based module detection methods shows that our approach could yield modules that are biologically more relevant and have stronger association with the studied disease. We expect for our method to become a part of the common toolbox for the disease module analysis, facilitating the discovery of new disease markers.",

			"abstract": "Cancer is a complex disease at many different levels. The molecular phenomenology of cancer is also quite rich. The mutational and genomic origins of cancer and their downstream effects on processes such as the reprogramming of the gene regulatory control and the molecular pathways depending on such control have been recognized as central to the characterization of the disease. More important though is the understanding of their causes, prognosis, and therapeutics. There is a multitude of factors associated with anomalous control of gene expression in cancer. Many of these factors are now amenable to be studied comprehensively by means of experiments based on diverse omic technologies. However, characterizing each dimension of the phenomenon individually has proven to fall short in presenting a clear picture of expression regulation as a whole. In this review article, we discuss some of the more relevant factors affecting gene expression control both, under normal conditions and in tumor settings. We describe the different omic approaches that we can use as well as the computational genomic analysis needed to track down these factors. Then we present theoretical and computational frameworks developed to integrate the amount of diverse information provided by such single-omic analyses. We contextualize this within a systems biology-based multi-omic regulation setting, aimed at better understanding the complex interplay of gene expression deregulation in cancer.",

			"abstract": "Unlike many cancers, the pattern of tumor evolution in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and its potential role in relapse have not been elucidated. In this study, multi-region whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on early-stage PTC tumors (n = 257 tumor regions) from 79 individuals, including 17 who had developed relapse, to understand the temporal and spatial framework within which subclonal mutations catalyze tumor evolution and its potential clinical relevance. Paired primary-relapse tumor tissues were also available for a subset of individuals. The resulting catalog of variants was analyzed to explore evolutionary histories, define clonal and subclonal events, and assess the relationship between intra-tumor heterogeneity and relapse-free survival. The multi-region WES approach was key in correctly classifying subclonal mutations, 40% of which would have otherwise been erroneously considered clonal. We observed both linear and branching evolution patterns in our PTC cohort. A higher burden of subclonal mutations was significantly associated with increased risk of relapse. We conclude that relapse in PTC, while generally rare, does not follow a predictable evolutionary path and that subclonal mutation burden may serve as a prognostic factor. Larger studies utilizing multi-region sequencing in relapsed PTC case subjects with matching primary tissues are needed to confirm these observations.",

Due to the lack of the knowledge about the molecular pathogenesis of breast cancer, therapeutic strategies remain inadequate, especially for aggressive breast cancer. In the present study, sequential bioinformatics analysis was performed using data from the GSE20711 dataset, and the results demonstrated that three genes may impact the survival of patients with breast cancer. One of these genes, RAD54 homolog B (RAD54B), may be a potential prognostic factor for breast cancer. A signature was established that could evaluate the overall survival for patients with breast cancer based on the risk score calculated from RAD54B expression and the Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) stage [risk score=expRAD54B \u00d7 0.236 + TNM stage (I/II=0 or III/IV=1) \u00d71.025]. In addition, based on the GSE85871 dataset and inhibitory assay, the study identified a natural compound, Japonicone A, which may reduce the proliferation of breast cancer cells by inhibiting the expression of RAD54B.

Treatment regimens should also include germline testing at least for cases suspicious of hereditary tumor diseases, followed by the analysis of somatic mutations within the tumor cell genome, raising a possible target for personalized therapy. Appropriate risk assessment is the key for suitable and, most importantly, individualized surveillance strategies especially in hereditary tumor syndromes.

We examine a mathematical model of an evolutionary process on a fitness landscape and obtain analytic solutions for the probability of multimutation leaps, that is, several mutations occurring simultaneously, within a single generation in 1 genome, and being fixed all together in the evolving population. The results indicate that, for typical, empirically observed combinations of the parameters of the evolutionary process, namely, effective population size, mutation rate, and distribution of selection coefficients of mutations, the probability of a multimutation leap is low, and accordingly the contribution of such leaps is minor at best. However, we show that, taking sign epistasis into account, leaps could become an important factor of evolution in cases of substantially elevated mutation rates, such as stress-induced mutagenesis in microbes. We hypothesize that stress-induced mutagenesis is an evolvable adaptive strategy.",

The use of large-scale and high-throughput cytogenomics technologies has led to a fast identification of several cancer candidate biomarkers associated with diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics. The advent of array comparative genomic hybridization and next-generation sequencing technologies has significantly improved the knowledge about cancer biology, underlining driver genes to guide targeted therapy development, drug-resistance prediction, and pharmacogenetics. However, few of these candidate biomarkers have made the transition to the clinic with a clear benefit for the patients. Technological progress helped to demonstrate that cellular heterogeneity plays a significant role in tumor progression and resistance/sensitivity to cancer therapies, representing the major challenge of precision cancer therapy. A paradigm shift has been introduced in cancer genomics with the recent advent of single-cell sequencing, since it presents a lot of applications with a clear benefit to oncological patients, namely, detection of intra-tumoral heterogeneity, mapping clonal evolution, monitoring the development of therapy resistance, and detection of rare tumor cell populations. It seems now evident that no single biomarker could provide the whole information necessary to early detect and predict the behavior and prognosis of tumors. The promise of precision medicine is based on the molecular profiling of tumors being vital the continuous progress of high-throughput technologies and the multidisciplinary efforts to catalogue chromosomal rearrangements and genomic alterations of human cancers and to do a good interpretation of the relation genotype-phenotype.",

Tumour mutation catalogues can reveal mutational signatures but are often consistent with the mutation spectra produced by a variety of mutagens. To date, after the analysis of tens of thousands of exomes and genomes from about 40 different cancer types, tens of mutational signatures characterized by a unique probability profile across the 96 trinucleotide-based mutation types have been identified, validated and catalogued. At the same time, several concurrent methods have been developed for either the quantification of the contribution of catalogued signatures in a given cancer sequence or the identification of new signatures from a sample of cancer sequences. A review of existing computational tools has been recently published to guide researchers and practitioners through their mutational signature analyses, but other tools have been introduced since its publication and, a systematic evaluation and comparison of the performance of such tools is still lacking. In order to fill this gap, we have carried out an empirical evaluation of the main packages available to date, using both real and simulated data. Among other results, our empirical study shows that the identification of signatures is more difficult for cancers characterized by multiple signatures each having a small contribution. This work suggests that detection methods based on probabilistic models, especially EMu and bayesNMF, have in general better performance than NMF-based methods.",

			"abstract": "The identification of recurrent point mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene, albeit in only a small percentage of glioblastomas a decade ago, has transformed our understanding of glioma biology, genomics and metabolism. More than 1000 scientific papers have been published since, propelling bench-to-bedside investigations that have led to drug development and clinical trials. The rapid biomedical advancement has been driven primarily by the realization of a neomorphic activity of IDH1 mutation that produces high levels of (d)-2-hydroxyglutarate, a metabolite believed to promote glioma initiation and progression through epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming. Thus, novel inhibitors of mutant IDH1 have been developed for therapeutic targeting. However, numerous clinical and experimental findings are at odds with this simple concept. By taking into consideration a large body of findings in the literature, this article analyzes how different approaches have led to opposing conclusions and proffers a counterintuitive hypothesis that IDH1 mutation is intrinsically tumor suppressive in glioma but functionally undermined by the glutamate-rich cerebral environment, inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes and IDH1 copy-number alterations. This theory also provides an explanation for some of the most perplexing observations, including the scarcity of proper model systems and the prevalence of IDH1 mutation in glioma.",

			"abstract": "Genetic alterations are essential for cancer initiation and progression. However, differentiating mutations that drive the tumor phenotype from mutations that do not affect tumor fitness remains a fundamental challenge in cancer biology. To better understand the impact of a given mutation within cancer, RNA-sequencing data was used to categorize mutations based on their allelic expression. For this purpose, we developed the MAXX (Mutation Allelic Expression Extractor) software, which is highly effective at delineating the allelic expression of both single nucleotide variants and small insertions and deletions. Results from MAXX demonstrated that mutations can be separated into three groups based on their expression of the mutant allele, lack of expression from both alleles, or expression of only the wild-type allele. By taking into consideration the allelic expression patterns of genes that are mutated in PDAC, it was possible to increase the sensitivity of widely used driver mutation detection methods, as well as identify subtypes that have prognostic significance and are associated with sensitivity to select classes of therapeutic agents in cell culture. Thus, differentiating mutations based on their mutant allele expression via MAXX represents a means to parse somatic variants in tumor genomes, helping to elucidate a gene's respective role in cancer.",

We identified immune-associated genes potentially dysregulated by alcohol or viral hepatitis B in HCC and validated alcohol-induced dysregulations in vitro while using large-scale RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Thirty-four clinically relevant dysregulated IA genes were identified. We profiled the correlation of all genomic alterations in HCC patients to IA gene expression while using the information theory-based algorithm REVEALER to investigate the molecular mechanism for their dysregulation and explore the possibility of genome-based patient stratification. We also studied gene expression regulators and identified multiple microRNAs that were implicated in HCC pathogenesis that can potentially regulate these IA genes' expression. Our study identified potential key pathways, including the IL-7 signaling pathway and TNFRSF4 (OX40)- NF-\u03baB pathway, to target in immunotherapy treatments and presents microRNAs as promising therapeutic targets for dysregulated IA genes because of their extensive regulatory roles in the cancer immune landscape.",

			"abstract": "Cancer driver mutations (CDMs) are necessary and causal for carcinogenesis and have advantages as reporters of carcinogenic risk. However, little progress has been made toward developing measurements of CDMs as biomarkers for use in cancer risk assessment. Impediments for using a CDM-based metric to inform cancer risk include the complexity and stochastic nature of carcinogenesis, technical difficulty in quantifying low-frequency CDMs, and lack of established relationships between cancer driver mutant fractions and tumor incidence. Through literature review and database analyses, this review identifies the most promising targets to investigate as biomarkers of cancer risk. Mutational hotspots were discerned within the 20 most mutated genes across the 10 deadliest cancers. Forty genes were identified that encompass 108 mutational hotspot codons overrepresented in the COSMIC database; 424 different mutations within these hotspot codons account for approximately 63,000 tumors and their prevalence across tumor types is described. The review summarizes literature on the prevalence of CDMs in normal tissues and suggests such mutations are direct and indirect substrates for chemical carcinogenesis, which occurs in a spatially stochastic manner. Evidence that hotspot CDMs (hCDMs) frequently occur as tumor subpopulations is presented, indicating COSMIC data may underestimate mutation prevalence. Analyses of online databases show that genes containing hCDMs are enriched in functions related to intercellular communication. In its totality, the review provides a roadmap for the development of tissue-specific, CDM-based biomarkers of carcinogenic potential, comprised of batteries of hCDMs and can be measured by error-correct next-generation sequencing.

			"abstract": "Cancer cells are mainly dependent on glycolysis for their growth and survival. Dietary carbohydrates play a critical role in the growth and proliferation of cancer and a low-carbohydrate diet may help slow down the growth of tumours. However, the exact mechanisms behind this effect are unclear. This review study aimed to investigate the effect of fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene in the association between dietary carbohydrates and cancer. This study was carried out using keywords such as polymorphism and/or cancer and/or dietary carbohydrate and/or FTO gene. PubMed and Science Direct databases were used to collect all related articles published from 1990 to 2018. Recent studies showed that the level of FTO gene expression in cancer cells is dramatically increased and may play a role in the growth of these cells through the regulation of the cellular metabolic pathways, including the phosphoinositide 3-kinases/protein kinaseB (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway. Dietary carbohydrate may influence the FTO gene expression by eliminating the inhibitory effect of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) on the FTO gene expression. This review summarised what has been recently discovered about the effects of dietary carbohydrate on cancer cells and tried to determine the mediating role of the FTO gene in these effects.",

			"abstract": "E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (HUWE1) has previously been identified as a HECT domain-containing ubiquitin ligase (E3) that is involved in several signaling pathways, transcriptional regulation, neural differentiation, DNA damage responses and apoptosis. However, the function of HUWE1 in the various types of cancer remains unclear. A previous study indicated that HUWE1 exhibited different roles depending on the cancer type due to the ubiquitination of various substrates. The objective of the present study was to determine whether HUWE1 can be employed as a prognostic indicator in human cancer. The expression of HUWE1 was examined using the Oncomine database, and gene alterations during carcinogenesis, copy number alterations and mutations of HUWE1 were then analyzed using cBioPortal, which is the International Cancer Genome Consortium and the Tumorscape database. Furthermore, the association between HUWE1 expression and patient survival was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier plotter and the PrognoScan databases. In addition, the present study attempted to establish the functional association between HUWE1 expression and cancer phenotypes, and the results revealed that HUWE1 may serve as a diagnostic marker or therapeutic target for certain types of cancer. HUWE1 may serve an oncogenic role in breast, brain and prostate cancer, while it may serve an anti-oncogenic role in colorectal cancer and certain lung cancers. The function of HUWE1 and its mechanisms require more in-depth and extensive investigation in future studies.",

			"abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified hundreds of genetic risk variants for human cancers. However, target genes for the majority of risk loci remain largely unexplored. It is also unclear whether GWAS risk-loci-associated genes contribute to mutational signatures and tumor mutational burden (TMB) in cancer tissues. We systematically conducted cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) analyses for 294 GWAS-identified variants for six major types of cancer-colorectal, lung, ovary, prostate, pancreas, and melanoma-by using transcriptome data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and other public data sources. By using integrative analysis strategies, we identified 270 candidate target genes, including 99 with previously unreported associations, for six cancer types. By analyzing functional genomic data, our results indicate that 180 genes (66.7% of 270) had evidence of cis-regulation by putative functional variants via proximal promoter or distal enhancer-promoter interactions. Together with our previously reported associations for breast cancer risk, our results show that 24 genes are shared by at least two cancer types, including four genes for both breast and ovarian cancer. By integrating mutation data from TCGA, we found that expression levels of 33 and 66 putative susceptibility genes were associated with specific mutational signatures and TMB of cancer-driver genes, respectively, at a Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.05. Together, these findings provide further insight into our understanding of how genetic risk variants might contribute to carcinogenesis through the regulation of susceptibility genes that are related to the biogenesis of somatic mutations.",

			"abstract": "Rapidly evolving microbes are a challenge to model because of the volatile, complex, and dynamic nature of their populations. We developed the DISSEQT pipeline (DIStribution-based SEQuence space Time dynamics) for analyzing, visualizing, and predicting the evolution of heterogeneous biological populations in multidimensional genetic space, suited for population-based modeling of deep sequencing and high-throughput data. The pipeline is openly available on GitHub (https://github.com/rasmushenningsson/DISSEQT.jl, accessed 23 June 2019) and Synapse (https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse: syn11425758, accessed 23 June 2019), covering the entire workflow from read alignment to visualization of results. Our pipeline is centered around robust dimension and model reduction algorithms for analysis of genotypic data with additional capabilities for including phenotypic features to explore dynamic genotype-phenotype maps. We illustrate its utility and capacity with examples from evolving RNA virus populations, which present one of the highest degrees of genetic heterogeneity within a given population found in nature. Using our pipeline, we empirically reconstruct the evolutionary trajectories of evolving populations in sequence space and genotype-phenotype fitness landscapes. We show that while sequence space is vastly multidimensional, the relevant genetic space of evolving microbial populations is of intrinsically low dimension. In addition, evolutionary trajectories of these populations can be faithfully monitored to identify the key minority genotypes contributing most to evolution. Finally, we show that empirical fitness landscapes, when reconstructed to include minority variants, can predict phenotype from genotype with high accuracy.",

			"abstract": "The relationships between inflammation and cancer are varied and complex. An important connection linking inflammation to cancer development is DNA damage. During inflammation reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) are created to combat pathogens and to stimulate tissue repair and regeneration, but these chemicals can also damage DNA, which in turn can promote mutations that initiate and promote cancer. DNA repair pathways are essential for preventing DNA damage from causing mutations and cytotoxicity, but RONS can interfere with repair mechanisms, reducing their efficacy. Further, cellular responses to DNA damage, such as damage signaling and cytotoxicity, can promote inflammation, creating a positive feedback loop. Despite coordination of DNA repair and oxidative stress responses, there are nevertheless examples whereby inflammation has been shown to promote mutagenesis, tissue damage, and ultimately carcinogenesis. Here, we discuss the DNA damage-mediated associations between inflammation, mutagenesis and cancer.",

			"abstract": "The canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT) is a cancer lineage that arose several millennia ago and survives by \"metastasizing\" between hosts through cell transfer. The somatic mutations in this cancer record its phylogeography and evolutionary history. We constructed a time-resolved phylogeny from 546 CTVT exomes and describe the lineage's worldwide expansion. Examining variation in mutational exposure, we identify a highly context-specific mutational process that operated early in the cancer's evolution but subsequently vanished, correlate ultraviolet-light mutagenesis with tumor latitude, and describe tumors with heritable hyperactivity of an endogenous mutational process. CTVT displays little evidence of ongoing positive selection, and negative selection is detectable only in essential genes. We illustrate how long-lived clonal organisms capture changing mutagenic environments, and reveal that neutral genetic drift is the dominant feature of long-term cancer evolution.",

CA IX is overexpressed in numerous hypoxic cancers where it promotes tumor progression. Therefore, it is considered as a promising tumor biomarker. A novel collection of MAbs against recombinant CA IX was developed and evaluated in different immunoassays for studying CA IX expression. The reactivity of MAbs with native cell surface protein was confirmed by flow cytometry and the presence of hypoxia-inducible CA IX was investigated in several human cancer cell lines. In addition, the applicability of MAbs for visualization of CA IX-positive tumor cells by immunofluorescence microscopy was demonstrated. MAb H7 was identified as the most promising MAb for different immunoassays. It recognized a linear epitope covering CA IX sequence of 12 amino acid residues 55-GEDDPLGEEDLP-66 within the proteoglycan domain. The MAb H7 was the only one of the collection to immunoprecipitate CA IX protein from cell lysates and detect the denatured CA IX with near-infrared fluorescence Western blot. It was also employed in sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect a soluble form of CA IX in growth medium of tumor cells and blood plasma samples. The diagnostic potential of the MAb H7 was confirmed on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue specimen of cervical carcinoma in situ by immunohistochemistry. The generated MAbs, in particularly clone H7, have great potential in diagnostics and research of CA IX-related cancers.",

We present FABRIC, a new framework for quantifying the selection of genes in cancer by assessing the effects of de-novo somatic mutations on protein-coding genes. Using a machine-learning model, we quantified the functional effects of \u223c3M somatic mutations extracted from over 10\u00a0000 human cancerous samples, and compared them against the effects of all possible single-nucleotide mutations in the coding human genome. We detected 593 protein-coding genes showing statistically significant bias towards harmful mutations. These genes, discovered without any prior knowledge, show an overwhelming overlap with known cancer genes, but also include many overlooked genes. FABRIC is designed to avoid false discoveries by comparing each gene to its own background model using rigorous statistics, making minimal assumptions about the distribution of random somatic mutations.

Pharmacological inhibition of mTOR kinase resulted in CHK1 checkpoint activation and decreased MCM2-7 replication helicase and PCNA associated with chromatins. Further pharmacological and genetic studies demonstrated CDC6 is positively controlled by mTORC1-S6K1 and mTORC2 signaling. miRNA screening revealed mTOR signaling suppresses miR-3178 thereby upregulating CDC6. Analysis of TCGA data found that CDC6 is overexpressed in most cancers and associates with the poor survival of cancer patients.

We analyzed microarray data of BC cell lines (GSE 48213) listed in the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Gene co-expression networks were used to construct and explore the biological function in hub modules using the weighted correlation network analysis algorithm method. Meanwhile, Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analysis were performed using Cytoscape plug-in ClueGo. The network of the key module was also constructed using Cytoscape. A total of 5000 genes were selected, 28 modules of co-expressed genes were identified from the gene co-expression network, one of which was found to be significantly associated with a subtype of BC lines. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the brown module was mainly involved in the pathway of the autophagy, spliceosome, and mitophagy, the black module was mainly enriched in the pathway of colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer, and genes in midnightblue module played critical roles in ribosome and regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes pathway.

			"abstract": "Tumors are heterogeneous tissues with different types of cells such as cancer cells, fibroblasts, and lymphocytes. Although the morphological features of tumors are critical for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, the underlying molecular events and genes for tumor morphology are far from being clear. With the advancement in computational pathology and accumulation of large amount of cancer samples with matched molecular and histopathology data, researchers can carry out integrative analysis to investigate this issue. In this study, we systematically examine the relationships between morphological features and various molecular data in breast cancers. Specifically, we identified 73 breast cancer patients from the TCGA and CPTAC projects matched whole slide images, RNA-seq, and proteomic data. By calculating 100 different morphological features and correlating them with the transcriptomic and proteomic data, we inferred four major biological processes associated with various interpretable morphological features. These processes include metabolism, cell cycle, immune response, and extracellular matrix development, which are all hallmarks of cancers and the associated morphological features are related to area, density, and shapes of epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and lymphocytes. In addition, protein specific biological processes were inferred solely from proteomic data, suggesting the importance of proteomic data in obtaining a holistic understanding of the molecular basis for tumor tissue morphology. Furthermore, survival analysis yielded specific morphological features related to patient prognosis, which have a strong association with important molecular events based on our analysis. Overall, our study demonstrated the power for integrating multiple types of biological data for cancer samples in generating new hypothesis as well as identifying potential biomarkers predicting patient outcome.

We provide reproducible solutions to solve these issues and use orthogonal approaches to validate our results.

In contrast, inactivation of telomerase is observed in most cells of the adult liver. Absence of telomerase activity and shortening of telomeres has been implicated in hepatocyte senescence and the development of cirrhosis, a chronic liver disease that can lead to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. During hepatocarcinogenesis, telomerase reactivation is required to enable the uncontrolled cell proliferation that leads to malignant transformation and HCC development. Part of the telomerase complex, telomerase reverse transcriptase, is encoded by TERT, and several mechanisms of telomerase reactivation have been described in HCC that include somatic TERT promoter mutations, TERT amplification, TERT translocation and viral insertion into the TERT gene. An understanding of the role of telomeres and telomerase in HCC development is important to develop future targeted therapies and improve survival of this disease. In this Review, the roles of telomeres and telomerase in liver carcinogenesis are discussed, in addition to their potential translation to clinical practice as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",

AXL (Anexelekto) is a tyrosine kinase receptor regulating viability, invasiveness and chemoresistance in various human cancers, including PTCs. Here, we analyze the role of AXL in PTC prognosis and as a marker of RAI refractoriness. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess AXL positivity in a cohort of human PTC samples. Normal and cancerous thyroid cell lines were used in vitro for signaling, survival and RAI uptake evaluations. 38.2% of human PTCs displayed high expression of AXL that positively correlated with RAI-refractoriness and disease persistence or recurrence, especially when combined with v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B(BRAF) V600E mutation. In human PTC samples, AXL expression correlated with V-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT1) and p65 nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) activation levels. Consistently, AXL stimulation with its ligand growth arrest-specific gene 6 (GAS6) increased AKT1- and p65 NF-kB-phosphorylation and promoted survival of thyroid cancer cell lines in culture. Enforced expression or activation of AXL in normal rat thyroid cells significantly reduced the expression of the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) and the radioiodine uptake. These data indicate that AXL expression levels could be used as predictor of RAI refractoriness and as a possible novel therapeutic target of RAI resistant PTCs.",

The Macaronesian Islands (i.e., Azores, Madeira, Selvagens, Canaries, and Cabo Verde), harbour biotas with exceptionally high levels of endemism. Within the region, the vascular plants and reptiles constitute two of the most important radiations. In this study we compare relevant published phylogenetic data and diversification rates retrieved within Cabo Verde endemic lineages and discuss the importance of choosing appropriate phylogeny-based methods to investigate diversification dynamics on islands. From this selective literature-based review, we summarize the software packages used in Macaronesian studies and discuss their adequacy considering the published data to obtain well-supported phylogenies in the target groups. We further debate the importance of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), to investigate the evolutionary processes of diversification in the Macaronesian Islands. Analysis of genomic data provides phylogenetic resolution for rapidly evolving species radiations, suggesting a great potential to improve the phylogenetic signal and divergence time estimates in insular lineages. The most important Macaronesian reptile radiations provide good case-studies to compare classical phylogenetic methods with new tools, such as phylogenomics, revealing a high value for research on this hotspot area.",

			"abstract": "Copy number variants (CNVs) are regions of the genome that vary in integer copy number. CNVs, which comprise both amplifications and deletions of DNA sequence, have been identified across all domains of life, from bacteria and archaea to plants and animals. CNVs are an important source of genetic diversity, and can drive rapid adaptive evolution and progression of heritable and somatic human diseases, such as cancer. However, despite their evolutionary importance and clinical relevance, CNVs remain understudied compared to single-nucleotide variants (SNVs). This is a consequence of the inherent difficulties in detecting CNVs at low-to-intermediate frequencies in heterogeneous populations of cells. Here, we discuss molecular methods used to detect CNVs, the limitations associated with using these techniques, and the application of new and emerging technologies that present solutions to these challenges. The goal of this short review and perspective is to highlight aspects of CNV biology that are understudied and define avenues for further research that address specific gaps in our knowledge of these complex alleles. We describe our recently developed method for CNV detection in which a fluorescent gene functions as a single-cell CNV reporter and present key findings from our evolution experiments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using a CNV reporter, we found that CNVs are generated at a high rate and undergo selection with predictable dynamics across independently evolving replicate populations. Many CNVs appear to be generated through DNA replication-based processes that are mediated by the presence of short, interrupted, inverted-repeat sequences. Our results have important implications for the role of CNVs in evolutionary processes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie CNV formation. We discuss the possible extension of our method to other applications, including tracking the dynamics of CNVs in models of human tumors.",

Understanding the sequence of mutation occurrence during cancer progression can assist early and accurate diagnosis and improve clinical decision-making. Here we employ long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, a class of recurrent neural network, to learn the evolution of a tumor through an ordered sequence of mutations. We demonstrate the capacity of LSTMs to learn complex dynamics of the mutational time series governing tumor progression, allowing accurate prediction of the mutational burden and the occurrence of mutations in the sequence. Using the probabilities learned by the LSTM, we simulate mutational data and show that the simulation results are statistically indistinguishable from the empirical data. We identify passenger mutations that are significantly associated with established cancer drivers in the sequence and demonstrate that the genes carrying these mutations are substantially enriched in interactions with the corresponding driver genes. Breaking the network into modules consisting of driver genes and their interactors, we show that these interactions are associated with poor patient prognosis, thus likely conferring growth advantage for tumor progression. Thus, application of LSTM provides for prediction of numerous additional conditional drivers and reveals hitherto unknown aspects of cancer evolution.",

To study the link between mutational burden and survival, we analyzed survival effects of tumor exonic missense mutation burden (TEMMB) across 6947 specimens spanning 31 cancers which have undergone whole exome sequencing as part of TCGA. We adjusted TEMMB for age, sex, stage, and recruitment center, and computed Cox-proportional models of TEMMB survival effects. We assigned a recurrence score (RS) to each cohort, defining RS as the burden of recurrent mutations exceeding 1% population prevalence. High TEMMB was associated with improved survival in cutaneous melanoma: hazard ratio (HR)\u2009=\u20090.71 [0.60-0.85], p\u2009=\u20090.0002, urothelial bladder carcinoma: HR\u2009=\u20090.74 [0.59-0.93], p\u2009=\u20090.01, and ovarian carcinoma: HR\u2009=\u20090.80 [0.70-0.93], p\u2009=\u20090.003. High TEMMB was associated with decreased survival in colorectal adenocarcinoma: HR\u2009=\u20091.32 [1.00-1.74], p\u2009<\u20090.05. We identified that TEMMB survival effects were governed by the balance of recurrent and non-recurrent mutations. In cancers with a low RS, high TEMMB was correlated with better survival outcomes (r\u2009=\u20090.49, p\u2009=\u20090.02). In conclusion, TEMMB effects on survival depend on recurrent mutation enrichment; tumor types that are highly enriched in passenger mutations show a survival benefit in the setting of high tumor mutational burden.",

Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death worldwide, with an estimated 1.6 million deaths each year.

			"abstract": "Drug resistance in breast cancer cell populations has been shown to arise through phenotypic transition of cancer cells to a drug-tolerant state, for example through epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition or transition to a cancer stem cell state. However, many breast tumors are a heterogeneous mixture of cell types with numerous epigenetic states in addition to stem-like and mesenchymal phenotypes, and the dynamic behavior of this heterogeneous mixture in response to drug treatment is not well-understood. Recently, we showed that plasticity between differentiation states, as identified with intracellular markers such as cytokeratins, is linked to resistance to specific targeted therapeutics. Understanding the dynamics of differentiation-state transitions in this context could facilitate the development of more effective treatments for cancers that exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity. In this work, we develop computational models of a drug-treated, phenotypically heterogeneous triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line to elucidate the feasibility of differentiation-state transition as a mechanism for therapeutic escape in this tumor subtype. Specifically, we use modeling to predict the changes in differentiation-state transitions that underlie specific therapy-induced changes in differentiation-state marker expression that we recently observed in the HCC1143 cell line. We report several statistically significant therapy-induced changes in transition rates between basal, luminal, mesenchymal, and non-basal/non-luminal/non-mesenchymal differentiation states in HCC1143 cell populations. Moreover, we validate model predictions on cell division and cell death empirically, and we test our models on an independent data set. Overall, we demonstrate that changes in differentiation-state transition rates induced by targeted therapy can provoke distinct differentiation-state aggregations of drug-resistant cells, which may be fundamental to the design of improved therapeutic regimens for cancers with phenotypic heterogeneity.",

			"abstract": "Cancers develop due to the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations. Genetic alterations are induced by aging, mutagenic chemicals, ultraviolet light, and other factors; whereas, epigenetic alterations are mainly by aging and chronic inflammation. The accumulation and patterns of alterations in normal cells reflect our past exposure levels and life history. Most accumulated alterations are considered as passengers, but their accumulation is correlated with cancer drivers. This has been shown for aberrant DNA methylation but has only been speculated for genetic alterations. However, recent technological advancements have enabled measurement of rare point mutations, and studies have shown that their accumulation levels are indeed correlated with cancer risk. When the accumulation levels of aberrant DNA methylation and point mutations are combined, risk prediction becomes even more accurate. When high levels of alterations accumulate, the tissue has a high risk of developing cancer or even multiple cancers and is considered as a \"cancerization field\", with or without expansion of physiological patches of clonal cells. In this review, we describe the formation of a cancerization field and how we can apply its detection in precision cancer risk diagnosis.",

			"abstract": "BRAC1 has multiple important interactions with triple-negative breast cancer, the specific molecular characteristics of this interaction, however, have not yet been completely elucidated. By examining cell signaling pathways, important information for comprehending the potential mechanisms of this cancer may become known. The aim of the present study was to identify the effects of BRAC1 and to find the signaling pathway(s) involved in the pathogenic mechanism of triple-negative breast cancer. In this study, GSE27447 microarray data were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from GSE27447 were distinguished by Significant Analysis of Microarray. Gene ontology (GO) analysis was carried out on 132 upregulated and 198 downregulated genes with DAVID. The signaling was forecast by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Transcription factors were recognized by TFatS. The BRAC1 relevant protein-protein interaction networks (PPI) were fixed by STRING and visualized by CytoScape. Overall, the upregulated DEGs, which included CR2, IGHM, PRKCB, CARD11, PLCG2, CD79A, IGKC and CD27, were primarily enriched in the terms associated with immune responses, and the downregulated DEGs, which included STARD3, ALDH8A1, SRD5A3, CACNA1H, UGT2B4, SDR16C5 and MED1, were primarily enriched in the hormone metabolic process. In addition, 13 pathways, such as the B-cell receptor-signaling pathway, the hormone synthesis signaling pathway and the oxytocin-signaling pathway, were chosen. MYC, SP1 and CTNNB1 were determined to be enriched in triple-negative breast cancer. A total of 8 genes were identified to be downregulated in the BRAC1-related PPI network. The results of the present study show a fresh angle on the molecular mechanism of triple-negative breast cancer and indicate a possible target for its treatment.",

Here we review emerging genomic markers of checkpoint blockade response, including those related to neoantigens, antigen presentation, DNA repair, and oncogenic pathways. Compelling evidence also points to a role for T cell functionality, checkpoint regulators, chromatin modifiers, and copy-number alterations in mediating selective response to immune checkpoint blockade. Ultimately, efforts to contextualize genomic correlates of response into the larger understanding of tumor immune biology will build a foundation for the development of novel biomarkers and therapies to overcome resistance to checkpoint blockade.",

The long tail of rare mutations complicates the discovery of mutually exclusive driver modules. The existing methods usually suffer from the problem that only few genes in some identified modules cover most of the cancer samples. To overcome this hurdle, an efficient method UniCovEx is presented via identifying mutually exclusive driver modules of balanced exclusive coverages. UniCovEx first searches for candidate driver modules with a strong topological relationship in signaling networks using a greedy strategy. It then evaluates the candidate modules by considering their coverage, exclusivity, and balance of coverage, using a novel metric termed exclusive entropy of modules, which measures how balanced the modules are. Finally, UniCovEx predicts sample-specific driver modules by solving a minimum set cover problem using a greedy strategy. When tested on 12 The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets of different cancer types, UniCovEx shows a significant superiority over the previous methods.

Through rigorous, integrative analysis of genomics data from a range of solid tumors, we show many transcriptional changes in tumors are tied to mutations disrupting regulatory interactions between unicellular and multicellular genes within human gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Recurrent point mutations were enriched in regulator genes linking unicellular and multicellular subnetworks, while copy-number alterations affected downstream target genes in distinctly unicellular and multicellular regions of the GRN. Our results depict drivers of tumourigenesis as genes that created key regulatory links during the evolution of early multicellular life, whose dysfunction creates widespread dysregulation of primitive elements of the GRN. Several genes we identified as important in this process were associated with drug response, demonstrating the potential clinical value of our approach.",

Here, we used a method that combines phylostratigraphy information with gene co-expression networks to extensively study the evolutionary compositions of OV. The present co-expression network construction yielded 18,549 nodes and 114,985 edges based on 307 OV expression samples obtained from the Genome Data Analysis Centers database. A total of 20 modules were identified as OV related clusters. The human genome sequences were divided into 19 phylostrata (PS), the majority (67.45%) of OV genes was already present in the eukaryotic ancestor. There were two strong peaks of the emergence of OV genes screened by hypergeometric test: the evolution of the multicellular metazoan organisms (PS5 and PS6, P value\u2009=\u20090.002) and the emergence of bony fish (PS11 and PS12, P value\u2009=\u20090.009). Hence, the origin of OV is far earlier than its emergence. The integrated analysis of the topology of OV modules and the phylogenetic data revealed an evolutionary pattern of OV in human, namely, OV modules have arisen step by step during the evolution of the respective lineages. New genes have evolved and become locked into a pathway, where more and more biological pathways are fixed into OV modules by recruiting new genes during human evolution.",

Driver gene lists predicted from these computational tools lack consistency and are prone to false positives. Here, we developed an approach (DriverML) integrating Rao's score test and supervised machine learning to identify cancer driver genes. The weight parameters in the score statistics quantified the functional impacts of mutations on the protein. To obtain optimized weight parameters, the score statistics of prior driver genes were maximized on pan-cancer training data. We conducted rigorous and unbiased benchmark analysis and comparisons of DriverML with 20 other existing tools in 31 independent datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrated that DriverML was robust and powerful among various datasets and outperformed the other tools with a better balance of precision and sensitivity. In vitro cell-based assays further proved the validity of the DriverML prediction of novel driver genes. In summary, DriverML uses an innovative, machine learning-based approach to prioritize cancer driver genes and provides dramatic improvements over currently existing methods.

Focusing on diseases with both genetic and viral contributors, we found significant convergent perturbation of the human domain-resolved interactome by endogenous genetic mutations and exogenous viral proteins inducing similar disease phenotypes. Pan-cancer, pan-oncovirus analysis further revealed that domains of human oncoproteins either physically targeted or structurally mimicked by oncoviruses are enriched for cancer driver rather than passenger mutations, suggesting convergent targeting of cancer driver pathways by diverse oncoviruses.

However, a prerequisite of this cell fusion search strategy is that such markers are stably expressed by TN-hybrid cells over time. However, cell fusion is a potent inducer of genomic instability, and TN-hybrid cells may lose these cell fusion markers, thereby becoming indistinguishable from nonfused tumor cells. In addition, hybrid cells can evolve from homotypic fusion events between tumor cells or from heterotypic fusion events between tumor cells and normal cells possessing similar markers, which would also be indistinguishable from nonfused tumor cells.

This would promote subpopulations derived from single cancer cells that exhibit distinct phenotypes while conserving vital pro-survival pathways. We aimed to identify significant drivers of cell fitness in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) creating subclones in different nutrient formulations to encourage differential metabolic reprogramming. The genetic and phenotypic expression profiles of each subclone were analyzed relative to a healthy control cell line (hTert-HPNE). The subclones exhibited distinct variations in protein expression and lipid metabolism. Relative to hTert-HPNE, PSN-1 subclones uniformly maintained modified sphingolipid signaling and specifically retained elevated sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) relative to C16 ceramide (C16 Cer) ratios. Each clone utilized a different perturbation to this pathway, but maintained this modified signaling to preserve cancerous phenotypes, such as rapid proliferation and defense against mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Although the subclones were unique in their sensitivity, inhibition of S1P synthesis significantly reduced the ratio of S1P/C16 Cer, slowed cell proliferation, and enhanced sensitivity to apoptotic signals. This reliance on S1P signaling identifies this pathway as a promising drug-sensitizing target that may be used to eliminate cancerous cells consistently across uniquely reprogrammed PDAC clones.",

			"abstract": "Mutations accumulate within somatic cells and have been proposed to contribute to aging. It is unclear what level of mutation burden may be required to consistently reduce cellular lifespan. Human cancers driven by a mutator phenotype represent an intriguing model to test this hypothesis, since they carry the highest mutation burdens of any human cell. However, it remains technically challenging to measure the replicative lifespan of individual mammalian cells. Here, we modeled the consequences of cancer-related mutator phenotypes on lifespan using yeast defective for mismatch repair (MMR) and/or leading strand (Pol\u03b5) or lagging strand (Pol\u03b4) DNA polymerase proofreading. Only haploid mutator cells with significant lifetime mutation accumulation (MA) exhibited shorter lifespans. Diploid strains, derived by mating haploids of various genotypes, carried variable numbers of fixed mutations and a range of mutator phenotypes. Some diploid strains with fewer than two mutations per megabase displayed a 25% decrease in lifespan, suggesting that moderate numbers of random heterozygous mutations can increase mortality rate. As mutation rates and burdens climbed, lifespan steadily eroded. Strong diploid mutator phenotypes produced a form of genetic anticipation with regard to aging, where the longer a lineage persisted, the shorter lived cells became. Using MA lines, we established a relationship between mutation burden and lifespan, as well as population doubling time. Our observations define a threshold of random mutation burden that consistently decreases cellular longevity in diploid yeast cells. Many human cancers carry comparable mutation burdens, suggesting that while cancers appear immortal, individual cancer cells may suffer diminished lifespan due to accrued mutation burden.",

Recent clinical studies have associated high TMB with improved patient response rates and survival benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors; hence, TMB is emerging as a biomarker of response for these immunotherapy agents. However, variability in current methods for TMB estimation and reporting is evident, demonstrating a need for standardization and harmonization of TMB assessment methodology across assays and centers. Two uniquely placed organizations, Friends of Cancer Research (Friends) and the Quality Assurance Initiative Pathology (QuIP), have collaborated to coordinate efforts for international multistakeholder initiatives to address this need. Friends and QuIP, who have partnered with several academic centers, pharmaceutical organizations, and diagnostic companies, have adopted complementary, multidisciplinary approaches toward the goal of proposing evidence-based recommendations for achieving consistent TMB estimation and reporting in clinical samples across assays and centers. Many factors influence TMB assessment, including preanalytical factors, choice of assay, and methods of reporting. Preliminary analyses highlight the importance of targeted gene panel size and composition, and bioinformatic parameters for reliable TMB estimation. Herein, Friends and QuIP propose recommendations toward consistent TMB estimation and reporting methods in clinical samples across assays and centers. These recommendations should be followed to minimize variability in TMB estimation and reporting, which will ensure reliable and reproducible identification of patients who are likely to benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors.",

The levels of C9orf53 were assayed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The levels of C9orf53 in cells were overexpressed by overexpression plasmid and inhibited by small-interfering RNA. Cell proliferation was assayed by MTT, and cell apoptosis was assessed by FACS analysis. It was demonstrated that C9orf53 deletion was associated with a decreased survival of patients. The level of C9orf53 in HNSCC tissues was lower compared with the matched normal tissues adjacent to tumors. A lower expression of C9orf53 promoted cell proliferation, and the overexpression of C9orf53 induced cell apoptosis. In conclusion, a low level of C9orf53 in HNSCC promoted the growth of HNSCC cells, which might be associated with the low survival rate of patients with HNSCC.",

			"abstract": "How can biophysical principles help precision medicine identify rare driver mutations? A major tenet of pragmatic approaches to precision oncology and pharmacology is that driver mutations are very frequent. However, frequency is a statistical attribute, not a mechanistic one. Rare mutations can also act through the same mechanism, and as we discuss below, \"latent driver\" mutations may also follow the same route, with \"helper\" mutations. Here, we review how biophysics provides mechanistic guidelines that extend precision medicine. We outline principles and strategies, especially focusing on mutations that drive cancer. Biophysics has contributed profoundly to deciphering biological processes. However, driven by data science, precision medicine has skirted some of its major tenets. Data science embodies genomics, tissue- and cell-specific expression levels, making it capable of defining genome- and systems-wide molecular disease signatures. It classifies cancer driver genes/mutations and affected pathways, and its associated protein structural data guide drug discovery. Biophysics complements data science. It considers structures and their heterogeneous ensembles, explains how mutational variants can signal through distinct pathways, and how allo-network drugs can be harnessed. Biophysics clarifies how one mutation-frequent or rare-can affect multiple phenotypic traits by populating conformations that favor interactions with other network modules. It also suggests how to identify such mutations and their signaling consequences. Biophysics offers principles and strategies that can help precision medicine push the boundaries to transform our insight into biological processes and the practice of personalized medicine. By contrast, \"phenotypic drug discovery,\" which capitalizes on physiological cellular conditions and first-in-class drug discovery, may not capture the proper molecular variant. This is because variants of the same protein can express more than one phenotype, and a phenotype can be encoded by several variants.",

Recent developments in the field have revealed that these subgroups are not as homogenous as previously believed. The objective of this study is to investigate the involvement of somatic driver gene mutations in these medulloblastoma subgroups. We obtained medulloblastoma data from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC), which contains distinct samples that were not previously studied in a large cohort. We identified somatic driver gene mutations and the signaling pathways affected by these driver genes for medulloblastoma subgroups using bioinformatics tools.

			"abstract": "Autophagy is an essential process of the eukaryotic cell allowing degradation and recycling of dysfunctional cellular components in response to either physiological or pathological changes. Inhibition of autophagy in combination with chemotherapeutic treatment has emerged as a novel approach in cancer treatment leading to cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis. Suberoyl hydroxamic acid (SAHA) is a broad-spectrum histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) suppressing family members in multiple HDAC classes. Increasing evidence indicates that SAHA and other HDACi can, in addition to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, also promote caspase-independent autophagy. SAHA-induced mTOR inactivation as a major regulator of autophagy activating the remaining autophagic core machinery is by far the most reported pathway in several tumor models. However, the question of which upstream mechanisms regulate SAHA-induced mTOR inactivation that consequently initiate autophagy has been mainly left unexplored. To elucidate this issue, we recently initiated a study clarifying different modes of SAHA-induced cell death in two human uterine sarcoma cell lines which led to the conclusion that the tumor suppressor protein p53 could act as a molecular switch between SAHA-triggered autophagic or apoptotic cell death. In this review, we present current research evidence about HDACi-mediated apoptotic and autophagic pathways, in particular with regard to p53 and its therapeutic implications.",

			"abstract": "Copy number variants (CNVs) are a pervasive source of genetic variation and evolutionary potential, but the dynamics and diversity of CNVs within evolving populations remain unclear. Long-term evolution experiments in chemostats provide an ideal system for studying the molecular processes underlying CNV formation and the temporal dynamics with which they are generated, selected, and maintained. Here, we developed a fluorescent CNV reporter to detect de novo gene amplifications and deletions in individual cells. We used the CNV reporter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study CNV formation at the GAP1 locus, which encodes the general amino acid permease, in different nutrient-limited chemostat conditions. We find that under strong selection, GAP1 CNVs are repeatedly generated and selected during the early stages of adaptive evolution, resulting in predictable dynamics. Molecular characterization of CNV-containing lineages shows that the CNV reporter detects different classes of CNVs, including aneuploidies, nonreciprocal translocations, tandem duplications, and complex CNVs. Despite GAP1's proximity to repeat sequences that facilitate intrachromosomal recombination, breakpoint analysis revealed that short inverted repeat sequences mediate formation of at least 50% of GAP1 CNVs. Inverted repeat sequences are also found at breakpoints at the DUR3 locus, where CNVs are selected in urea-limited chemostats. Analysis of 28 CNV breakpoints indicates that inverted repeats are typically 8 nucleotides in length and separated by 40 bases. The features of these CNVs are consistent with origin-dependent inverted-repeat amplification (ODIRA), suggesting that replication-based mechanisms of CNV formation may be a common source of gene amplification. We combined the CNV reporter with barcode lineage tracking and found that 102-104 independent CNV-containing lineages initially compete within populations, resulting in extreme clonal interference. However, only a small number (18-21) of CNV lineages ever constitute more than 1% of the CNV subpopulation, and as selection progresses, the diversity of CNV lineages declines. Our study introduces a novel means of studying CNVs in heterogeneous cell populations and provides insight into their dynamics, diversity, and formation mechanisms in the context of adaptive evolution.",

Addressing this, the PsychENCODE Consortium has generated a comprehensive online resource for the adult brain across 1866 individuals.

Integration shows that varying cell-type proportions largely account for the cross-population variation in expression (with >88% reconstruction accuracy). It also allows building of a gene regulatory network, linking genome-wide association study variants to genes (e.g., 321 for schizophrenia). We embed this network into an interpretable deep-learning model, which improves disease prediction by ~6-fold versus polygenic risk scores and identifies key genes and pathways in psychiatric disorders.",

Developments in these areas of research contribute to the ongoing discovery of structural variation with a clear impact on the evolution of the tumour and on the clinical importance to the patient. Recent large whole genome sequencing studies have reinforced our impression of each tumour as a unique combination of mutations but paradoxically have also discovered similar genome-wide patterns of single-nucleotide and structural variation between tumours. Statistical methods have been developed to deconvolute mutation patterns, or signatures, that recur across samples, providing information about the mutagens and repair processes that may be active in a given tumour. These signatures can guide treatment by, for example, highlighting vulnerabilities in a particular tumour to a particular chemotherapy. Thus, although the complete reconstruction of the full evolutionary trajectory of a tumour genome remains currently out of reach, valuable data are already emerging to improve the treatment of cancer.",

This has largely been facilitated by gene panel testing, which allows for a better understanding of the genetic basis for an individual's response to therapy. NGS-based comprehensive gene panel testing is a clinically useful approach to investigate genomic mechanisms, including therapy-related signaling pathways, microsatellite instability, hypermutated phenotypes, and tumor mutation burden.

In NSCLC cases, we compared the progression-free survival (PFS) of \"POG-informed therapies\" with the PFS of the last regimen prior to POG (PFS ratio). In 29 NSCLC cases, 11 were male (38%), the median age was 60.2 yr (range: 39.4-72.6), and histologies included were adenocarcinoma (93%) and squamous cell carcinoma (7%).

			"abstract": "The introduction in the clinic of immune checkpoint inhibitors (IOs) has represented an important improvement for the treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These drugs have shown a higher activity as compared with chemotherapy in both first- and second-line of treatment, with some patients experiencing a long-lasting response. More recently, combinations of IOs have entered clinical trials in different tumor types including NSCLC. Nevertheless, IOs are active only in a subgroup of patients and biomarkers for appropriate patients' selection are urgently needed to offer the patients an effective therapy, and also to manage the costs. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) has powerfully emerged as a potential biomarker for immunotherapy and might enter the clinic in the next months, although different challenges are still unsolved. Different methods exist to evaluate TMB in tissue, ranging from whole exome sequencing (WES) to targeted sequencing of smaller sets of genes, which need to be fully standardized to ensure that patients receive an appropriate TMB test with clear clinical interpretation. In addition, as already happened for the implementation of liquid biopsy testing from NSCLC patients to identify targetable alterations, researchers are also evaluating the possibility to calculate TMB in blood, to further enlarge the number of NSCLC patients who may benefit from immunotherapy. Preliminary data highlight the difficulty to develop targeted sequencing panels for the assessment of TMB starting from the circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA). The applicability of TMB testing on liquid biopsy needs further investigation and may be clarified within the ongoing clinical trials.",

			"abstract": "Anti-programmed death (ligand)-1 [anti-PD-(L)1] therapies such as pembrolizumab, nivolumab or atezolizumab have become standard of care for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients either in first line or beyond. PD-L1 expression level allows enriching the treated population with responders, but it is still not an optimal biomarker. Even in patients with PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) levels of \u226550% treated with first line pembrolizumab overall response rate (ORR) is only 44.8% and overall survival at one year is 70%. Moreover, in combination trials with chemotherapy and anti-PD-(L)1 therapy, a significant proportion of patients does not respond (ORR ranges from 45.3% to 64.0%), regardless of PD-L1 expression. Furthermore, PD-L1 expression level is not associated with improved benefit in patients treated with combinations of anti-PD-(L)1 and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen (anti-CTLA4) therapy. One of the new promising biomarkers is tumor mutational burden (TMB). It has been discovered that especially tumor types with a known high mutation rate such as NSCLC and melanoma respond best to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). An explanation is that this high mutation rate makes it more likely that neoantigens arise that are targeted by activated immune cells, but it is not feasible to determine neoantigen load in daily practice. However, TMB of a certain tumor type is associated with neoantigen load and outcome on ICIs. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the TMB analysis methods, the rationale to use TMB as a predictive biomarker and the clinical utility of TMB in NSCLC patients treated with ICIs.",

Somatic mutations in blood progenitors can provide insight into the rate and processes underlying this accumulation, as well as the developmental lineage tree and stem cell division numbers. Here, we catalog mutations in the genomes of human-bone-marrow-derived and umbilical-cord-blood-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). We find that mutations accumulate gradually during life with approximately 14 base substitutions per year. The majority of mutations were acquired after birth and could be explained by the constant activity of various endogenous mutagenic processes, which also explains the mutation load in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using these mutations, we construct a developmental lineage tree of human hematopoiesis, revealing a polyclonal architecture and providing evidence that developmental clones exhibit multipotency. Our approach highlights features of human native hematopoiesis and its implications for leukemogenesis.",

			"abstract": "During the past few years, although scientists and researchers have studied variations in the cancer genomes, our current knowledge about the function of Micro-inversions (MIs) in cancer are still limited. MIs are generally defined as small inversions in DNA segments shorter than 100 bp. To expand our knowledge of their roles in cancer, we analyzed the MIs of 209 samples from four types of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and bladder cancer. Within all the 209 samples, we identified 2,925 MIs, of which 1,519 (51.93%) are in gene regions. Of the 1,519 MIs in the gene regions, 106 (6.98%) are in the exon regions. We also analyzed 209 healthy samples as the control samples. We further analyzed the distribution of MIs in the four types of cancer among 24 chromosomes. Besides the chromosome preference, different cancers also have different preference for various genes. The MIs preference for different genes among four types of cancer may provide a guidance for the treatment and diagnosis on the four types of cancer. Medical doctors should concentrate more on chromosomes and the genes that MIs prefer to locate on. We also calculated the average count of MIs per individual among each cancer. From this result, we found that the bladder cancer has the most average count of MIs per individual, which means MIs may be more likely to exist in bladder cancer. According to our analysis, MIs play an important role in cancer and should be considered for further analysis.",

Mutational signatures derive from the frequency of mutated trinucleotides in a given cancer sample, and they provide an avenue for investigating the underlying mutational processes that operate in cancer. Here we analyse somatic mutations from 7,815 cancer exomes from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) across 26 cancer types. We curate a list of 50 known cancer driver mutations by analysing recurrence in our cohort and annotations of known cancer-associated genes from the Cancer Gene Census, IntOGen database and Cancer Genome Interpreter. We then use these datasets to perform binary univariate logistic regression and establish the statistical relationship between individual driver mutations and known mutational signatures across different cancer types. Our analysis led to the identification of 39 significant associations between driver mutations and mutational signatures (P < 0.004, with a false discovery rate of < 5%). We first validate our methodology by establishing statistical links for known and novel associations between driver mutations and the mutational signature arising from Polymerase Epsilon proofreading deficiency. We then examine associations between driver mutations and mutational signatures for AID/APOBEC enzyme activity and deficient mismatch repair. We also identify negative associations (odds ratio < 1) between mutational signatures and driver mutations, and here we examine the role of aging and cigarette smoke mutagenesis in the generation of driver mutations in IDH1 and KRAS in brain cancers and lung adenocarcinomas respectively. Our study provides statistical foundations for hypothesised links between otherwise independent biological processes and we uncover previously unexplored relationships between driver mutations and mutagenic processes during cancer development. These associations give insights into how cancers acquire advantageous mutations and can provide direction to guide further mechanistic studies into cancer pathogenesis.",

Here, we performed whole-exome sequencing of 16 breast cancer tissues classified according to ESR1 expression and 12 samples of whole blood, and detected 310 somatic mutations in cancer tissues with high levels of ESR1 expression. Of the somatic mutations validated by a different deep sequencer, a novel nonsense somatic mutation, c.2830\u2009C>T; p.Gln944*, in transcriptional regulator switch-independent 3 family member A (SIN3A) was detected in breast cancer of a patient. Part of the mutant protein localized in the cytoplasm in contrast to the nuclear localization of ER\u03b1, and induced a significant increase in ESR1 mRNA. The SIN3A mutation obviously enhanced MCF7 cell proliferation. In tissue sections from the breast cancer patient with the SIN3A c.2830\u2009C>T mutation, cytoplasmic SIN3A localization was detected within the tumor regions where nuclear enlargement was observed. The reduction in SIN3A mRNA correlates with the recurrence of ER-positive breast cancers on Kaplan-Meier plots. These observations reveal that the SIN3A mutation has lost its transcriptional repression function due to its cytoplasmic localization, and that this repression may contribute to the progression of breast cancer.",

Most of the subtyping schemes used in clinics today are derived from analyses of microarray data from thousands of different tumors together with clinical data for the patients from which the tumors were isolated. However, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is gradually replacing microarrays as the preferred transcriptomics platform, and although transcript abundances measured by the two different technologies are largely compatible, subtyping methods developed for probe-based microarray data are incompatible with RNA-Seq as input data. Here, we present an RNA-Seq data processing pipeline, which relies on the mapping of sequencing reads to the probe set target sequences instead of the human reference genome, thereby enabling probe-based subtyping of breast cancer tumor tissue using sequencing-based transcriptomics. By analyzing 66 breast cancer tumors for which gene expression was measured using both microarrays and RNA-Seq, we show that RNA-Seq data can be directly compared to microarray data using our pipeline. Additionally, we demonstrate that the established subtyping method CITBCMST (Guedj et\u00a0al., ), which relies on a 375 probe set-signature to classify samples into the six subtypes basL, lumA, lumB, lumC, mApo, and normL, can be applied without further modifications.

When evaluated on six somatic mutation datasets of Pan-Cancer and 19 datasets of different cancer types from TCGA, MaxMIF almost always significantly outperforms all the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of predictive accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. It recovers about 30% more known cancer genes in 500 top-ranked candidate genes than the best among the other tools evaluated. MaxMIF is also highly robust to data perturbation.

Total 120 somatic mutations were identified in 190 of the 313 patients (60.7%), with the mutation frequency of AKT1 as 3.2%, PIK3CA as 36.4%, PTEN as 4.8%, and TP53 as 33.9%. Among these mutations, 1 in PIK3CA (p.I69N), 3 in PTEN (p.K62X, c.635-12_636delTTAACCATGCAGAT and p.N340IfsTer4) and 5 in TP53 (p.Q136AfsTer5, p.K139_P142del, p.Y234dup, p.V274LfsTer31 and p.N310TfsTer35) were novel. Notably, PIK3CA somatic mutations were significantly associated with ER-positive or PR-positive tumors. TP53 somatic mutations were significantly associated with ER-negative, PR-negative, HER2-positive, BRCA1 mutation, Ki67 high expression and basal-like tumors. Our findings provided a comprehensive mutation profiling of AKT1, PIK3CA, PTEN and TP53 genes in Chinese breast cancer patients, which have potential implications in clinical management.",

			"abstract": "PIK3CA is one of the most commonly mutated genes in solid cancers. PIK3CA mutations are also found in benign overgrowth syndromes, collectively known as PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS). As in cancer, PIK3CA mutations in PROS arise postzygotically, but unlike in cancer, these mutations arise during embryonic development, with their timing and location critically influencing the resulting disease phenotype. Recent evidence indicates that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway inhibitors undergoing trials in cancer can provide a therapy for PROS. Conversely, PROS highlights gaps in our understanding of PI3K's role during embryogenesis and in cancer development. Here, we summarize current knowledge of PROS, evaluate challenges and strategies for disease modeling, and consider the implications of PROS as a paradigm for understanding activating PIK3CA mutations in human development and cancer.",

However, emerging studies suggest that PARP inhibition can also target HR-competent cancers, such as non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and that the therapeutic effect of PARP inhibition may be improved by combination with chemotherapy agents. In our study, it was found that PARP inhibitors talazoparib (BMN-673) and olaparib (AZD-2281) both had synergistic activity with the common first-line chemotherapeutic gemcitabine in a panel of lung cancer cell lines. Furthermore, the combination demonstrated significant in vivo antitumor activity in an H23 xenograft model of NSCLC compared to either agent as monotherapy. This synergism occurred without loss of HR repair efficiency. Instead, the combination induced synergistic single-strand DNA breaks, leading to accumulation of toxic double-strand DNA lesions in vitro and in vivo. Our study elucidates the underlying mechanisms of synergistic activity of PARP inhibitors and gemcitabine, providing a strong motivation to pursue this combination as an improved therapeutic regimen.",

			"abstract": "Rejuvenation of stem cell activity might increase life expectancy by prolonging functionality of organs. Higher stem cell replication rates also bear the risk of cancer. The extent of this risk is not known. While it is difficult to evaluate this cancer risk in experiments, it can be estimated using a mathematical model for tissue homeostasis by stem cell replication and associated cancer risk. The model recapitulates the observation that treatments targeting stem cell replication can induce a substantial delay of organ failure. The model predicts that the cancer risk is minor under particular conditions. It depends on the assumed implications for cell damage repair during treatment. The benefit of rejuvenation therapy and its impact on cancer risk depend on the biological age at the time of treatment and on the overall cell turnover rate of the organs. Different organs have to be considered separately in the planning of systemic treatments. In recent years, the transfer of blood from young to old individuals was shown to bear the potential of rejuvenation of stem cell activity. In this context, the model predicts that the treatment schedule is critical for success and that schedules successful in animal experiments are not transferable to humans. Guidelines for successful protocols are proposed. The model presented here may be used as a guidance for the development of stem cell rejuvenation treatment protocols and the identification of critical parameters for cancer risk.",

			"abstract": "Most cancer driver genes are involved in generic cellular processes such as DNA repair, cell proliferation and cell adhesion, yet their mutations are often confined to specific cancer types. To resolve this paradox, we explained mutation frequencies of selected genes across tumor types with four features in the corresponding normal tissues from cancer-free subjects: mRNA expression and chromatin accessibility of mutated genes, mRNA expressions of their neighbors in curated pathways and the protein-protein interaction network. Encouragingly, these transcriptomic/epigenomic features in normal tissues were closely associated with mutational/functional characteristics in tumors. First, chromatin accessibility was a necessary but not sufficient condition for frequent mutations. Second, variations of mutation frequencies in selected genes across tissue types were significantly associated with all four features. Third, the genes possessing significant associations between mutation frequency variations and pathway gene expression were enriched with documented cancer genes. We further proposed a novel bivariate gene set enrichment analysis and confirmed that the pathway gene expression was the dominant factor in cancer gene enrichment. These findings shed lights on the functional roles of genes in normal tissues in shaping the mutational landscape during tumor genome evolution.",

UV-damage mutations were present in \u223c45% of the iPSCs and accounted for most of the observed heterogeneity in mutation rates across lines. Subclonal mutations (not present in all iPSCs within a line) composed 10% of point mutations and, compared with clonal variants, showed an enrichment in active promoters and increased association with altered gene expression. Our study shows that, by combining WGS, transcriptome, and epigenome data, we can understand the mutational burden of each iPSC line on an individual basis and suggests that this information could be used to prioritize iPSC lines for models of specific human diseases and/or transplantation therapy.",

Based on Tetz's theory of longevity, we propose that lifespan and aging are defined by the accumulation of alterations over all genes of macroorganism and microbiome and the non-living genetic elements associated with them. Tetz's law of longevity states that longevity is limited by the accumulation of alterations to the limiting value that is not compatible with life. Based on theory and law, we also propose a novel model to calculate several parameters, including the rate of aging and the remaining lifespan of individuals. We suggest that this theory and model have explanatory and predictive potential to eukaryotic organisms, allowing the influence of diseases, medication, and medical procedures to be re-examined in relation to longevity.

Understanding breast cancer heterogeneity is necessary to develop preventive interventions and targeted therapies. A recently emerging concept is that intratumor heterogeneity is driven by cancer stem cells (CSCs) that are capable of giving rise to a multitude of different cells within a tumor. Studies have highlighted linkage of CSC formation with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).

The lack of a simple method for genome-wide analysis of alterations induced by mutagens hampers the identification of trinucleotide signatures of mutagen exposure and evaluation of their relationships with human cancers. Here, we describe a novel approach to facilitate analysis of chemically induced mutations in bacterial cells by detection of increased frequencies of base substitutions after mutagen exposure, using paired-end overlapping next-generation sequencing. DNA samples from Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100, exposed to three alkylating agents, ethylnitrosourea (ENU), methylnitrosourea (MNU), and ethyl methansulphonate (EMS), were analysed. The G:C\u2009>\u2009A:T mutation frequency was increased in all samples, whereas A:T base pair substitution frequencies were increased specifically in samples exposed to ENU, consistent with previous reports. Mutation patterns in the context of 96 possible trinucleotide formats in these samples exhibited a sharp peak corresponding to an NpCpY consensus sequence, which is similar to the mutational signature of alkylating agents in human cancer. These results indicate that our approach can be useful in facilitating the understanding of mechanisms underlying chemical mutagenicity and for identification of unknown causal mutagens in human cancer.",

Several chromatin associated enzymes have been shown to influence post-translational modification (PTM) in DNA, histones, and non-histone proteins. Any deregulation of this core group of enzymes often leads to cancer development. Ubiquitylation of histone H2B in mammalian cells was identified over three decades ago. An exciting really interesting new gene (RING) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, known as RNF20 and RNF40, monoubiquitinates histone H2A at K119 or H2B at K120, is known to function in transcriptional elongation, DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair processes, maintenance of chromatin differentiation, and exerting tumor suppressor activity. RNF20 is somatically altered in breast, lung, prostate cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), and mixed lineage leukemia, and its reduced expression is a key factor in initiating genome instability; and it also functions as one of the significant driving factors of oncogenesis. Loss of RNF20/40 and H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub1) is found in several cancers and is linked to an aggressive phenotype, and is also an indicator of poor prognosis. In this review, we summarized the current knowledge of RNF20 in chronic inflammation-driven cancers, DNA DSBs, and apoptosis, and its impact on chromatin structure beyond the single nucleosome level.",

			"abstract": "The antiviral metabolites from bacterial stress response to bacteriophage infection can maintain homeostasis of host cells, while metabolism disorder is a remarkable characteristic of tumorigenesis. In the aspect of metabolic homeostasis, therefore, the antiviral homeostasis-maintaining metabolites of bacteria may possess anti-tumor activity. However, this issue has not been addressed. Here we show that the homeostasis-challenged maintaining metabolites from deep-sea bacteriophage-challenged thermophile can suppress tumor metastasis. The results indicated that the metabolic profiles of the bacteriophage GVE2-infected and virus-free thermophile Geobacillus sp. E263 from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent were remarkably different. Thirteen metabolites were significantly elevated and two metabolites were downregulated in thermophile stress response to GVE2 infection. As an example, the upregulated L-norleucine was characterized. The data showed that L-norleucine had antiviral activity in thermophile. Furthermore, the in vitro and in vivo assays revealed that L-norleucine, as well as its derivative, significantly suppressed metastasis of gastric and breast cancer cells. L-norleucine interacted with hnRNPA2/B1 protein to inhibit the expressions of Twist1 and Snail, two inhibitors of E-cadherin, and promote the E-cadherin expression, leading to the inhibition of tumor metastasis. Therefore, our study presented that antiviral homeostasis-maintaining metabolites of microbes might be a promising source for anti-tumor drugs.",

We applied it to a chemorefractory metastatic case of the extremely rare urachal carcinoma. Quantitative comparison of lung metastases and surrounding tissue revealed several significantly upregulated proteins, among them lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1A). LSD1 is an epigenetic regulator and the target of active development efforts in oncology. Thus, clinical cancer proteomics can rapidly and efficiently identify actionable therapeutic options.

Interestingly, \u03b2-catenin/TCF(T cell factor)-responsive promoter activity exhibited a significant positive association with IGF-1R/IR TKI response, while the mutational status of direct upstream genes, such as CTNNB1 and APC, was not significantly associated with the response. The \u03b2-catenin/TCF activity high cell lines express components of IGF-1R/IR signaling more than the low cell lines explaining their enhanced sensitivity against IGF-1R/IR TKI. Reinforcing \u03b2-catenin/TCF responsive promoter activity by introducing CTNNB1 gain-of-function mutations into IGF-1R/IR TKI-resistant cells increased the expression and activity of IGF-1R/IR signaling components and also sensitized the cells to IGF-1R/IR TKIs in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of TCGA data revealed that the stronger \u03b2-catenin/TCF responsive promoter activity was associated with higher IGF-1R and IGF2 transcription in human colon cancer specimens as well. Collectively, compared to the mutational status of upstream genes, \u03b2-catenin/TCF responsive promoter activity has potential to be a stronger predictive positive biomarker for IGF-1R/IR TKI responses in colon cancer cells. The present study highlights the potential of transcriptional activity as therapeutic biomarkers for targeted therapies, overcoming the limited ability of upstream genetic mutations to predict responses.",

DNA adducts can serve as biomarkers for interspecies comparisons of the biologically effective dose of procarcinogens and permit extrapolation of genotoxicity data from animal studies for human risk assessment. One major challenge in DNA adduct biomarker research is the paucity of fresh frozen biopsy samples available for study. However, archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues with clinical diagnosis of disease are often available. We have established robust methods to recover DNA free of crosslinks from FFPE tissues under mild conditions which permit quantitative measurements of DNA adducts by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The technology is versatile and can be employed to screen for DNA adducts formed with a wide range of environmental and dietary carcinogens, some of which were retrieved from section-cuts of FFPE blocks stored at ambient temperature for up to nine years. The ability to retrospectively analyze FFPE tissues for DNA adducts for which there is clinical diagnosis of disease opens a previously untapped source of biospecimens for molecular epidemiology studies that seek to assess the causal role of environmental chemicals in cancer etiology.",

			"abstract": "Cancer is currently viewed as a disease of evolving genomic instability and abnormal epigenomic modifications. Most solid cancers harbor oncogenic gene mutations driven by both extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like family (APOBEC) enzymes have an intrinsic deamination activity to convert cytosine to uracil during RNA editing and retrovirus or retrotransposon restriction. Beyond their natural defense in innate immunity, compelling evidence showed that a subclass of APOBEC3 can cause high mutation burden in various types of cancer genomes, and high expression subtypes of APOBEC3 may contribute to drug resistance and associate with clinical outcomes. The underlying molecular mechanisms of APOBEC-mediated hypermutation phenotype are poorly understood. In this review, we discuss the linkage of activation-induced deaminase (AID)/APOBEC3 enzymes to tumorigenesis, highlight the dysregulatory mechanisms of APOBEC3 activities during cancer development, and propose potential approaches to targeting APOBEC3-mediated mutagenesis for cancer interventions.",

Different molecular processes frequently generate different signatures of somatic mutations in their own favored contexts. As a result, the regional somatic mutation rate is dependent on the local DNA sequence, the DNA replication/RNA transcription dynamics and epigenomic chromatin organization landscape in the genome. Here, we propose an online computational framework, termed Mutalisk, which correlates somatic mutations with various genomic, transcriptional and epigenomic features in order to understand mutational processes that contribute to the generation of the mutations. This user-friendly tool explores the presence of localized hypermutations (kataegis), dissects the spectrum of mutations into the maximum likelihood combination of known mutational signatures and associates the mutation density with numerous regulatory elements in the genome. As a result, global patterns of somatic mutations in any query sample can be efficiently screened, thus enabling a deeper understanding of various mutagenic factors. This tool will facilitate more effective downstream analyses of cancer genome sequences to elucidate the diversity of mutational processes underlying the development and clonal evolution of cancer cells.

We observed 78-88% of the miR-379/miR-656 cluster (C14MC) miRNAs were downregulated in three sub-types of diffuse gliomas, which was also corroborated with analysis from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets. The miRNA expression levels decreased with increasing tumor grade, indicating this downregulation as an early event in gliomagenesis. Higher expression of the C14MC miRNAs significantly improved glioblastioma prognosis (Pearson's r\u2009=\u20090.62; p\u2009<\u20093.08e-22). ENCODE meta-data analysis, followed by reporter assays validated existence of two novel internal regulators within C14MC. CRISPR activation of the most efficient internal regulator specifically induced members of the downstream miRNA sub-cluster and apoptosis in glioblastoma cells. Luciferase assays validated novel targets for miR-134 and miR-485-5p, two miRNAs from C14MC with the most number of target genes relevant for glioma. Overexpression of miR-134 and miR-485-5p in human glioblastoma cells suppressed invasion and proliferation, respectively. Furthermore, apoptosis was induced by both miRs, individually and in combination. The results emphasize the tumor suppressive role of C14MC in diffuse gliomas, and identifies two specific miRNAs with potential therapeutic value and towards better disease management and therapy.",

In examining 3,080 tumor samples from 8 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas, rDriver predicted 1,389 driver mutations. Compared with existing tools, rDriver identified more low frequency mutations associated with lineage specific functional properties, timing of occurrence and patient survival.

			"abstract": "The recognition of RNA functions beyond canonical protein synthesis has challenged the central dogma of molecular biology. Indeed, RNA is now known to directly regulate many important cellular processes, including transcription, splicing, translation, and epigenetic modifications. The misregulation of these processes in disease has led to an appreciation of RNA as a therapeutic target. This potential was first recognized in bacteria and viruses, but discoveries of new RNA classes following the sequencing of the human genome have invigorated exploration of its disease-related functions in mammals. As stable structure formation is evolving as a hallmark of mammalian RNAs, the prospect of utilizing small molecules to specifically probe the function of RNA structural domains and their interactions is gaining increased recognition. To date, researchers have discovered bioactive small molecules that modulate phenotypes by binding to expanded repeats, microRNAs, G-quadruplex structures, and RNA splice sites in neurological disorders, cancers, and other diseases. The lessons learned from achieving these successes both call for additional studies and encourage exploration of the plethora of mammalian RNAs whose precise mechanisms of action remain to be elucidated. Efforts toward understanding fundamental principles of small molecule-RNA recognition combined with advances in methodology development should pave the way toward targeting emerging RNA classes such as long noncoding RNAs. Together, these endeavors can unlock the full potential of small molecule-based probing of RNA-regulated processes and enable us to discover new biology and underexplored avenues for therapeutic intervention in human disease.

			"abstract": "Our understanding of the genetics of colorectal cancer has changed dramatically over recent years. Colorectal cancer can be classified in multiple different ways. Along with the advent of whole-exome sequencing, we have gained an understanding of the scale of the genetic changes found in sporadic colorectal cancer. We now know that there are multiple pathways that are commonly involved in the evolution of colorectal cancer including Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, RAS, EGFR, and PIK3 kinase. Another recent leap in our understanding of colorectal cancer genetics is the recognition that many, if not all tumors, are actually genetically heterogeneous within individual tumors and also between tumors. Recent research has revealed the prognostic and possibly therapeutic implications of various specific mutations, including specific mutations in ",

			"abstract": "The diversity of somatic mutations in human cancers can be decomposed into individual mutational signatures, patterns of mutagenesis that arise because of DNA damage and DNA repair processes that have occurred in cells as they evolved towards malignancy. Correlations between mutational signatures and environmental exposures, enzymatic activities and genetic defects have been described, but human cancers are not ideal experimental systems-the exposures to different mutational processes in a patient's lifetime are uncontrolled and any relationships observed can only be described as an association. Here, we demonstrate the proof-of-principle that it is possible to recreate cancer mutational signatures in vitro using CRISPR-Cas9-based gene-editing experiments in an isogenic human-cell system. We provide experimental and algorithmic methods to discover mutational signatures generated under highly experimentally-controlled conditions. Our in vitro findings strikingly recapitulate in vivo observations of cancer data, fundamentally validating the concept of (particularly) endogenously-arising mutational signatures.",

			"abstract": "Nanotechnology has emerged as a promising tool in the clinic to combat several difficult-to-manage diseases, such as cancer, which is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Chemotherapeutic drugs present several limitations such as undesired side effects, low specificity, resistance, and high relapse rates. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is caused by cells that lack specific receptors in their membrane, such as estrogen (ER+) and progesterone (PR+) receptors, or by cells that do not express the amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2+). This cancer type has poor prognosis, high relapse rates, and no targeted therapies. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the trends of nanotechnology research in TNBC and compare the contribution of research from different regions, institutions, and authors. A search of the studies published between 2012 and 2017, related to nanotechnology and TNBC, with different keyword combinations, was performed in the Scopus database. The keywords found in this search were grouped into four clusters, in which \"breast cancer\" was the most mentioned (1,133 times) and the word \"MCF-7 cell line\" is one of the latest hotspots that appeared in the year 2016. A total of 1,932 articles, which were cited 26,450 times, were identified.

			"abstract": "Cancer hallmarks are evolutionary traits required by a tumour to develop. While extensively characterised, the way these traits are achieved through the accumulation of somatic mutations in key biological pathways is not fully understood. To shed light on this subject, we characterised the landscape of pathway alterations associated with somatic mutations observed in 4,415 patients across ten cancer types, using 374 orthogonal pathway gene-sets mapped onto canonical cancer hallmarks. Towards this end, we developed SLAPenrich: a computational method based on population-level statistics, freely available as an open source R package. Assembling the identified pathway alterations into sets of hallmark signatures allowed us to connect somatic mutations to clinically interpretable cancer mechanisms. Further, we explored the heterogeneity of these signatures, in terms of ratio of altered pathways associated with each individual hallmark, assuming that this is reflective of the extent of selective advantage provided to the cancer type under consideration. Our analysis revealed the predominance of certain hallmarks in specific cancer types, thus suggesting different evolutionary trajectories across cancer lineages. Finally, although many pathway alteration enrichments are guided by somatic mutations in frequently altered high-confidence cancer genes, excluding these driver mutations preserves the hallmark heterogeneity signatures, thus the detected hallmarks' predominance across cancer types. As a consequence, we propose the hallmark signatures as a ground truth to characterise tails of infrequent genomic alterations and identify potential novel cancer driver genes and networks.",

Since binary representation does not capture biological context, its use is limited in many applications such as discovering novel driver mutations.

Abnormal activation of signaling pathways is involved in tumor pathogenesis and plays critical roles in growth, progression, and relapse of cancers. Targeted therapies against effectors in oncogenic signaling have improved the outcomes of cancer patients. NF\u03baB is an important signaling pathway involved in pathogenesis and treatment of cancers. Excessive activation of the NF\u03baB-signaling pathway has been documented in various tumor tissues, and studies on this signaling pathway for targeted cancer therapy have become a hot topic.

The neutral mutational process is very complex: whole-genome analyses have revealed that the mutation rate differs between cancer types, between patients and along the genome depending on the genetic and epigenetic context. Therefore, methods that predict the number of different types of mutations in regions or specific genomic elements must consider local genomic explanatory variables. A major drawback of most methods is the need to average the explanatory variables across the entire region or genomic element. This procedure is particularly problematic if the explanatory variable varies dramatically in the element under consideration.",

We outline future research directions toward the goal of enhancing human radioresistance, including upregulation of endogenous repair and radioprotective mechanisms, possible leeways into gene therapy in order to enhance radioresistance via the translation of exogenous and engineered DNA repair and radioprotective mechanisms, the substitution of organic molecules with fortified isoforms, and methods of slowing metabolic activity while preserving cognitive function.

Here, we focus on alternate mechanisms-those without mutations, such as phenotypic plasticity and stochastic cell-to-cell variability that can also evade drug attacks by giving rise to drug-tolerant persisters. The phenomenon of persistence has been well-studied in bacteria and has also recently garnered attention in cancer. We draw a parallel between bacterial persistence and resistance against androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer (PCa), the primary standard care for metastatic disease. We illustrate how phenotypic plasticity and consequent mutation-independent or non-genetic heterogeneity possibly driven by protein conformational dynamics can stochastically give rise to androgen independence in PCa, and suggest that dynamic phenotypic plasticity should be considered in devising therapeutic dosing strategies designed to treat and manage PCa.",

A current challenge in the field is to be able to distinguish benign adenoma (FA) from preoperatively malignant thyroid follicular carcinoma (FTC), which are very similar both histologically and genetically. One controversial issue, which is currently not understood, is whether both tumor types represent different molecular entities or rather a biological continuum. To gain a better insight into FA and FTC tumorigenesis, we defined their molecular profiles by mRNA and miRNA microarray. Expression data were analyzed, validated by qRT-PCR and compared with previously published data sets. The majority of deregulated mRNAs were common between FA and FTC and were downregulated, however FTC showed additional deregulated mRNA. Both types of tumors share deregulated pathways, molecular functions and biological processes. The additional deregulations in FTC include the lipid transport process that may be involved in tumor progression. The strongest candidate genes which may be able to discriminate follicular adenomas and carcinomas, CRABP1, FABP4 and HMGA2, were validated in independent samples by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. However, they were not able to adequately classify FA or FTC, supporting the notion of continuous evolving tumors, whereby FA and FTC appear to show quantitative rather than qualitative changes. Conversely, miRNA expression profiles showed few dysregulations in FTC, and even fewer in FA, suggesting that miRNA play a minor, if any, role in tumor progression.",

Some remarkable achievements have been made; however, the exact mechanisms of tumor initiation and development remain unclear. Cancer is a complex, whole-body disease that involves multiple abnormalities in the levels of DNA, RNA, protein, metabolite and medical imaging. Biological omics including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and radiomics aims to systematically understand carcinogenesis in different biological levels, which is driving the shift of cancer research paradigm from single parameter model to multi-parameter systematical model. The rapid development of various omics technologies is driving one to conveniently get multi-omics data, which accelerates predictive, preventive and personalized medicine (PPPM) practice allowing prediction of response with substantially increased accuracy, stratification of particular patients and eventual personalization of medicine. This review article describes the methodology, advances, and clinically relevant outcomes of different \"omics\" technologies in cancer research, and especially emphasizes the importance and scientific merit of integrating multi-omics in cancer research and clinically relevant outcomes.",

All mice that received the AAV-mTSG library developed liver cancer and died within 4 months. We used molecular inversion probe sequencing of the sgRNA target sites to chart the mutational landscape of these tumors, revealing the functional consequence of multiple variants in driving liver tumorigenesis in immunocompetent mice.

			"abstract": "Despite substantial advances in the treatment of various cancers, many patients still receive anti-cancer therapies that hardly eradicate tumor cells but inflict considerable side effects. To provide the best treatment regimen for an individual patient, a major goal in molecular oncology is to identify predictive markers for a personalized therapeutic strategy. Regarding novel targeted anti-cancer therapies, there are usually good markers available. Unfortunately, however, targeted therapies alone often result in rather short remissions and little cytotoxic effect on the cancer cells. Therefore, classical chemotherapy with frequent long remissions, cures, and a clear effect on cancer cell eradication remains a corner stone in current anti-cancer therapy. Reliable biomarkers which predict the response of tumors to classical chemotherapy are rare, in contrast to the situation for targeted therapy. For the bulk of cytotoxic therapeutic agents, including DNA-damaging drugs, drugs targeting microtubules or antimetabolites, there are still no reliable biomarkers used in the clinic to predict tumor response. To make progress in this direction, meticulous studies of classical chemotherapeutic drug action and resistance mechanisms are required. For this purpose, novel functional screening technologies have emerged as successful technologies to study chemotherapeutic drug response in a variety of models. They allow a systematic analysis of genetic contributions to a drug-responsive or -sensitive phenotype and facilitate a better understanding of the mode of action of these drugs. These functional genomic approaches are not only useful for the development of novel targeted anti-cancer drugs but may also guide the use of classical chemotherapeutic drugs by deciphering novel mechanisms influencing a tumor's drug response. Moreover, due to the advances of 3D organoid cultures from patient tumors and in vivo screens in mice, these genetic screens can be applied using conditions that are more representative of the clinical setting. Patient-derived 3D organoid lines furthermore allow the characterization of the \"essentialome\", the specific set of genes required for survival of these cells, of an individual tumor, which could be monitored over the course of treatment and help understanding how drug resistance evolves in clinical tumors. Thus, we expect that these functional screens will enable the discovery of novel cancer-specific vulnerabilities, and through clinical validation, move the field of predictive biomarkers forward. This review focuses on novel advanced techniques to decipher the interplay between genetic alterations and drug response.",

However, the complexity of mutation profiles of cancer patients hinders the further understanding to mechanisms of oncogenesis. One basic question is how to find mutations with functional impacts. In this work, we introduce a computational method to predict functional somatic mutations of each patient by integrating mutation recurrence with expression profile similarity. With this method, the functional mutations are determined by checking the mutation enrichment among a group of patients with similar expression profiles. We applied this method to three cancer types and identified the functional mutations. Comparison of the predictions for three cancer types suggested that most of the functional mutations were cancer-type-specific with one exception to ",

Upon injury or stress, new signals emanating from damaged tissue can divert nearby cells into adopting behaviours that are not part of their homeostatic repertoire. This behaviour, known as SC plasticity, typically resolves as wounds heal. However, in cancer, it can endure. Recent studies have yielded insights into the orchestrators of maintenance and lineage commitment for SCs belonging to three mammalian tissues: the haematopoietic system, the skin epithelium and the intestinal epithelium. We delineate the multifactorial determinants and general principles underlying the remarkable facets of SC plasticity, which lend promise for regenerative medicine and cancer therapeutics.",

Due to its long latency period, PCa is considered as an ideal cancer type for chemopreventive interventions. Chemopreventive agents include various natural or synthetic agents that prevent or delay cancer development, progression and/or recurrence. Pre-clinical studies suggest that many natural products and dietary agents have chemopreventive properties. However, a limited number of these agents have been tested in clinical trials, with varying success. In this review, we have discussed the available clinical studies regarding the efficacy of natural chemopreventive agents against PCa, including tea polyphenols, selenium, soy proteins, vitamins and resveratrol. We have also provided a discussion on the clinical challenges and opportunities for the potential use of chemopreventive agents against PCa. Based on available literature, it appears that the variable outcomes of the chemopreventive clinical studies necessitate a need for additional studies with more rigorous designs and methodical interpretations in order to measure the potential of the natural agents against PCa.",

From a data perspective, we use model selection (Akaike information criterion) to show that this model, which is based on the Weibull distribution, outperforms other simple models like the Gamma distribution. From a modeling perspective, the Weibull distribution can be justified as modeling the accumulation of driver events, which establishes a link to stem cell division based cancer development models and a connection to a recursion formula for intrinsic cancer risk published by Wu et al. For the recursion formula a closed form solution is given, which will help to simplify future analyses. Additionally, we perform a sensitivity analysis for the parameters, showing that two of the three parameters can vary over several orders of magnitude. However, the shape parameter of the Weibull distribution, which corresponds to the number of driver mutations required for cancer onset, can be robustly estimated from epidemiological data.",

While it is widely held that the phenomenon is genetic in nature, emerging evidence suggests that non-genetic mechanisms may also be important. Furthermore, at least in some cases, refractoriness to treatment can be reversed by epigenetic reprogramming, and combination and intermittent therapies, as opposed to sustained monotherapy, appear more effective in attenuating it. Here we iterate the confusion in understanding the phenomenon by which cancer cells evade drug response and underscore the need to recognize the genetic/non-genetic duality of drug resistance in cancer.

However, the underlying mechanisms for the anti-proliferative activity of these inhibitors are still not fully characterized. In this study, we demonstrated that BET inhibitor JQ1 suppressed the proliferation and invasiveness of gastric cancer cells by inducing cellular senescence. Depletion of BRD4, which was overexpressed in gastric cancer tissues, but not other BET proteins recapitulated JQ1-induced cellular senescence with increased cellular SA-\u03b2-Gal activity and elevated p21 levels. In addition, we showed that the levels of p21 were regulated at the post-transcriptional level by BRD4-dependent expression of miR-106b-5p, which targets the 3'-UTR of p21 mRNA. Overexpression of miR-106b-5p prevented JQ1-induced p21 expression and BRD4 inhibition-associated cellular senescence, whereas miR-106b-5p inhibitor up-regulated p21 and induced cellular senescence. Finally, we demonstrated that inhibition of E2F suppressed the binding of BRD4 to the promoter of miR-106b-5p and inhibited its transcription, leading to the increased p21 levels and cellular senescence in gastric cancer cells. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which BRD4 regulates cancer cell proliferation by modulating the cellular senescence through E2F/miR-106b-5p/p21 axis and provide new insights into using BET inhibitors as potential anticancer drugs.",

We report here an acute monoblastic leukemia (AMoL) patient who later developed an unclassifiable myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN-U). Whole-exome sequencing and cluster analysis demonstrated the presence of three distinct major clones during the clinical course: (1) an AMoL clone with ASXL1, CBL, and NPM1 somatic mutations, likely associated with the pathogenesis, and GATA2, SRSF2, and TET2 mutations, (2) an AMoL remission clone, with mutated GATA2, SRSF2, and TET2 only (possibly the founding clone (pre-leukemic HSC) that survived chemotherapy), (3) a small subclone which had JAK2 mutation during the AMoL remission, appearing at MPN-U manifestation with additional mutations. These findings suggest that pre-leukemic HSCs in AML patients may give rise to non-AML myeloid malignancies. This is the first report to analyze the clonal evolution from AMoL to MPN-U, which may provide new insight into the development of myeloid malignancies.",

However, their relative importance has never been examined, as measurement of low-level mutations has been difficult. Here, we measured low-level accumulations of genetic and epigenetic alterations in normal tissues with low, intermediate, and high cancer risk and analyzed their relative effects on cancer risk in the esophagus and stomach. Accumulation of genetic alterations, estimated as a frequency of rare base substitution mutations, significantly increased according to cancer risk in esophageal mucosae, but not in gastric mucosae. The mutation patterns reflected the exposure to lifestyle risk factors. In contrast, the accumulation of epigenetic alterations, measured as DNA methylation levels of marker genes, significantly increased according to cancer risk in both tissues. Patients with cancer (high-risk individuals) were precisely discriminated from healthy individuals with exposure to risk factors (intermediate-risk individuals) by a combination of alterations in the esophagus (odds ratio, 18.2; 95% confidence interval, 3.69-89.9) and by only epigenetic alterations in the stomach (odds ratio, 7.67; 95% confidence interval, 2.52-23.3). The relative importance of epigenetic alterations upon genetic alterations was 1.04 in the esophagus and 2.31 in the stomach.

By delineating human and murine separation-of-function p53 alleles, we find that p53 null and gain-of-function (GOF) mutations exhibit defects in restart of stalled or damaged DNA replication forks that drive genomic instability, which isgenetically separable from transcription activation. By assaying protein-DNA fork interactions in single cells, we unveil a p53-MLL3-enabled recruitment of MRE11 DNA replication restart nuclease. Importantly, p53 defects or depletion unexpectedly allow mutagenic RAD52 and POL\u03b8 pathways to hijack stalled forks, which we find reflected in p53 defective breast-cancer patient COSMIC mutational signatures. These data uncover p53 as a keystone regulator of replication homeostasis within a DNA restart network. Mechanistically, this has important implications for development of resistance in cancer therapy.

However, few methods consider the functional non-equal roles of genes in pathways and the complex gene-gene interactions in a network.",

			"abstract": "The global health burden associated with melanoma continues to increase while treatment options for metastatic melanoma are limited. Nevertheless, in the past decade, the field of cancer immunotherapy has witnessed remarkable advances for the treatment of a number of malignancies including metastatic melanoma. Although the earliest observations of an immunological antitumor response were made nearly a century ago, it was only in the past 30\u2009years, that immunotherapy emerged as a viable therapeutic option, in particular for cutaneous melanoma. As such, melanoma remains the focus of various preclinical and clinical studies to understand the immunobiology of cancer and to test various tumor immunotherapies. Here, we review key recent developments in the field of immune-mediated therapy of melanoma. Our primary focus is on therapies that have received regulatory approval. Thus, a brief overview of the pathophysiology of melanoma is provided. The purported functions of various tumor-infiltrating immune cell subsets are described, in particular the recently described roles of intratumoral dendritic cells. The section on immunotherapies focuses on strategies that have proved to be the most clinically successful such as immune checkpoint blockade. Prospects for novel therapeutics and the potential for combinatorial approaches are delineated. Finally, we briefly discuss nanotechnology-based platforms which can in theory, activate multiple arms of immune system to fight cancer. The promising advances in the field of immunotherapy signal the dawn of a new era in cancer treatment and warrant further investigation to understand the opportunities and barriers for future progress.",

In order to detect the mutation frequencies and to define their prognostic value for associated clinicopathologic features and survival of patients, resected \u0394Np63/p40-positive SCC of the lung (n\u2009=\u2009101) were screened for FGFR1 gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization performed on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissues and for the presumed driver mutations in genes of FGFR2 and FGFR3 by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Twenty-two of 101 SCCs (22%) were positive for amplification based on a FGFR1/centromere (chromosome 8) ratio >\u20092.0 or higher. In advanced tumor stages (III-IV), the overall survival of patients carrying FGFR1 gene amplification was significantly higher (p\u2009=\u20090.006). Among women, FGFR1 gene amplification was significantly associated with longer overall survival (p\u2009=\u20090.023). The presence of FGFR1 gene amplification was associated with patient age (65 versus 69\u00a0years, p\u2009=\u20090.046), but not with gender, tumor stage, histologic subtype, tumor grade, or \u0394Np63/p40 immunoreactivity. The S249C mutation in the FGFR3 gene was identified in one out of 101 SCCs (1%); the K600N, K660E, or R248C mutations were not identified. These results suggest that FGFR1 gene amplification is a frequent alteration in SCC of the lung and appears not to be a negative but rather a favorable prognostic marker for women and particularly for patients with advanced SCC of the lung (stage III-IV).",

We show that MLL-AF9 cells critically depend on FLT3-ligand induced pathways as well as on BRD3/4 for their survival. We evaluated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of the BRD3/4 inhibitor I-BET151 in various human MLL-AF9 (primary) models and patient samples and analyzed the transcriptome changes following treatment. To further understand the mode of action of BRD3/4 inhibition, we performed ChIP-seq experiments on the MLL-AF9 complex in THP1 cells and compared it to RNA-seq data of I-BET151 treated cells. While we could confirm a consistent and specific downregulation of key-oncogenic drivers such as MYC and BCL2, we found that the majority of I-BET151-responsive genes were not direct MLL-AF9 targets. In fact, MLL-AF9 specific targets such as the HOXA cluster, MEIS1 and other cell cycle regulators such as CDK6 were not affected by I-BET151 treatment. Furthermore, we also highlight how MLL-AF9 transformed cells are dependent on the function of non-mutated hematopoietic transcription factors and tyrosine kinases such as the FLT3-TAK1/NF-kB pathway, again impacting on BCL2 but not on the HOXA cluster. We conclude that BRD3/4 and the FLT3-TAK1/NF-kB pathways collectively control a set of targets that are critically important for the survival of human MLL-AF9 cells.",

Field cancerization, which is the replacement of the normal cell population by a cancer-primed cell population that may show no morphological change, is now recognized to underlie the development of many types of cancer, including the common carcinomas of the lung, colon, skin, prostate and bladder. Field cancerization is the consequence of the evolution of somatic cells in the body that results in cells that carry some but not all phenotypes required for malignancy. Here, we review the evidence of field cancerization across organs and examine the biological mechanisms that drive the evolutionary process that results in field creation. We discuss the clinical implications, principally, how measurements of the cancerized field could improve cancer risk prediction in patients with pre-malignant disease.",

The current models of the mechanism of DSB repair are based on studies of DNA repair proteins. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently emerged as new regulatory molecules, with diverse functions in biological processes. In the present study, we found that expression of the ionizing radiation-inducible lncRNA, lnc-RI, was correlate negatively with micronucleus frequencies in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Knockdown of lnc-RI significantly increased spontaneous DSBs levels, which was confirmed to be associated with the decreased efficiency of homologous recombination (HR) repair of DSBs. The expression of RAD51, a key recombinase in the HR pathway, decreased sharply in lnc-RI-depressed cells. In a further investigation, we demonstrated that miR-193a-3p could bind with both lnc-RI and RAD51 mRNA and depressed the expression of lnc-RI and RAD51 mRNA. Lnc-RI acted as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to stabilize RAD51 mRNA via competitive binding with miR-193a-3p and release of its inhibition of RAD51 expression. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the role of lnc-RI in regulating HR repair of DSBs. The feedback loop established in the current study suggests that lnc-RI is critical for the maintenance of genomic stability.",

We identified previously reported functionally relevant phosphosites and potentially novel regulatory residues in enzymes of the central carbon metabolism. In particular, we showed that pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHA1) enzymatic activity is inhibited by increased phosphorylation in FH-deficient cells, restricting carbon entry from glucose to the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Moreover, we confirmed PDHA1 phosphorylation in human FH-deficient tumours. Our work provides a novel approach to investigate how post-translational modifications of enzymes regulate metabolism and could have important implications for understanding the metabolic transformation of FH-deficient cancers with potential clinical applications.",

These CTCs can remain in circulation or colonize new sites, forming metastatic clones in distant organs. Recently, CTC analyses have been successfully used as effective clinical tools to monitor tumor progression and prognosis. With advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) and single-cell sequencing (SCS) technologies, scientists can obtain the complete genome of a CTC and compare it with corresponding primary and metastatic tumors. CTC sequencing has been successfully applied to monitor genomic variations in metastatic and recurrent tumors, infer tumor evolution during treatment, and examine gene expression as well as the mechanism of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. However, compared with cancer biopsy sequencing and circulating tumor DNA sequencing, the sequencing of CTC genomes and transcriptomes is more complex and technically difficult. Challenges include enriching pure tumor cells from a background of white blood cells, isolating and collecting cells without damaging or losing DNA and RNA, obtaining unbiased and even whole-genome and transcriptome amplification material, and accurately analyzing CTC sequencing data. Here, we review and summarize recent studies using NGS on CTCs. We mainly focus on CTC genome and transcriptome sequencing and the biological and potential clinical applications of these methodologies.

We construct a statistical model that separates fragile sites from regions showing signatures of positive selection for homozygous deletions and identify candidate tumour suppressors within those regions.

			"abstract": "Cancer is traditionally considered a genetic disease. It starts with a gene mutation, often caused by environmental carcinogens that are enzymatically activated to metabolites that covalently bind to DNA. If these now-damaged carcinogen-DNA adducts are not repaired before the cell replicates, they result in a mutation, which is inherited by daughter cells and their subsequent progeny. Still more mutations are added that are thought to advance cellular independence, metastasis, and drug resistance, among other characteristics typically observed for advanced cancer. The stages of initiation, promotion and progression of cancer by mutations infer irreversibility because back mutations are exceedingly rare. Thus, treatment protocols typically are designed to remove or kill cancer cells by surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and/or radiotherapy. However, empirical evidence has existed to show a fundamentally different treatment option. For example, the promotion of cancer growth and development in laboratory animals initiated by a powerful mutagen/carcinogen can be repetitively turned on and off by non-mutagenic mechanisms, even completely, by modifying the consumption of protein at relevant levels of intake. Similar but less substantiated evidence also exists for other nutrients and other cancer types. This suggests that ultimate cancer development is primarily a nutrition-responsive disease rather than a genetic disease, with the understanding that nutrition is a comprehensive, wholistic biological effect that reflects the natural contents of nutrients and related substances in whole, intact food. This perspective sharply contrasts with the contemporary inference that nutrition is the summation of individual nutrients acting independently. The spelling of 'holism' with the 'w' is meant to emphasize the empirical basis for this function. The proposition that wholistic nutrition controls and even reverses disease development suggests that cancer may be treated by nutritional intervention.",

We uncovered new driver mutations in the replication-repair-associated DNA polymerases and a distinct impact of microsatellite instability and replication repair deficiency on the scale of mutation load. Unbiased clustering, based on mutational context, revealed clinically relevant subgroups regardless of the tumors' tissue of origin, highlighting similarities in evolutionary dynamics leading to hypermutation.

Here, we integrate cancer cell fraction, population recurrence, and functional impact of somatic mutations as signatures of selection into a Bayesian model for driver prediction. We demonstrate that our model, cDriver, outperforms competing methods when analyzing solid tumors, hematological malignancies, and pan-cancer datasets. Applying cDriver to exome sequencing data of 21 cancer types from 6,870 individuals revealed 98 unreported tumor type-driver gene connections. These novel connections are highly enriched for chromatin-modifying proteins, hinting at a universal role of chromatin regulation in cancer etiology. Although infrequently mutated as single genes, we show that chromatin modifiers are altered in a large fraction of cancer patients. In summary, we demonstrate that integration of evolutionary signatures is key for identifying mutational driver genes, thereby facilitating the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for cancer treatment.",

			"abstract": "Recent genomic analyses have revealed substantial tumor heterogeneity across various cancers. However, it remains unclear whether and how genomic heterogeneity is constrained during tumor evolution. Here, we sequence a unique cohort of multiple synchronous lung cancers (MSLCs) to determine the relative diversity and uniformity of genetic drivers upon identical germline and environmental background. We find that each multicentric primary tumor harbors distinct oncogenic alterations, including novel mutations that are experimentally demonstrated to be functional and therapeutically targetable. However, functional studies show a strikingly constrained tumorigenic pathway underlying heterogeneous genetic variants. These results suggest that although the mutation-specific routes that cells take during oncogenesis are stochastic, genetic trajectories may be constrained by selection for functional convergence on key signaling pathways. Our findings highlight the robust evolutionary pressures that simultaneously shape the expansion and constraint of genomic diversity, a principle that holds important implications for understanding tumor evolution and optimizing therapeutic strategies.Across cancer types tumor heterogeneity has been observed, but how this relates to tumor evolution is unclear. Here, the authors sequence multiple synchronous lung cancers, highlighting the evolutionary pressures that simultaneously shape the expansion and constraint of genomic heterogeneity.",

Here, we describe a set of tools to rapidly clone and stratify thousands of cancer mutations at base resolution. This protocol provides a massively parallel pipeline to achieve high stringency and throughput. The approach includes high-throughput generation of mutant clones by Gateway, confirmation of variant identity by barcoding and next-generation sequencing, and stratification of cancer variants by multiplexed interaction profiling. Compared with alternative site-directed mutagenesis methods, our protocol requires less sequencing effort and enables robust statistical calling of allele-specific effects. To ensure the precision of variant interaction profiling, we further describe two complementary methods-a high-throughput enhanced yeast two-hybrid (HT-eY2H) assay and a mammalian-cell-based Gaussia princeps luciferase protein-fragment complementation assay (GPCA). These independent assays with standard controls validate mutational interaction profiles with high quality. This protocol provides experimentally derived guidelines for classifying candidate cancer alleles emerging from whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing projects as 'drivers' or 'passengers'. For \u223c100 genomic mutations, the protocol-including target primer design, variant library construction, and sequence verification-can be completed within as little as 2-3 weeks, and cancer variant stratification can be completed within 2 weeks.",

This effect was observed even after adjustment for features such as GC percentage, chromatin, and replication timing. Furthermore, mutational signatures differed between the nuclear core and periphery, thus indicating differences in the patterns of DNA-damage or DNA-repair processes. For instance, smoking and UV-related signatures, as well as substitutions at certain motifs, were more enriched in the nuclear periphery. Thus, the nuclear architecture may influence mutational landscapes in cancer genomes beyond the previously described effects of chromatin structure and replication timing.",

We introduce a method, nCOP, that considers per-individual mutational profiles within the context of protein-protein interaction networks in order to identify small connected subnetworks of genes that, while not individually frequently mutated, comprise pathways that are altered across (i.e., \"cover\") a large fraction of individuals. By analyzing 6,038 samples across 24 different cancer types, we demonstrate that nCOP is highly effective in identifying cancer genes, including those with low mutation frequencies.

			"abstract": "Although adenocarcinoma (ADC) is the most frequent lung cancer, its diagnosis is often late, when the local invasion is important and/or the metastases have already appeared. Therefore, the mortality at 5 years is still very high, ranging from 51% to 99%, depending on the stage. The implementation of different molecular techniques has allowed genomic studies even in relatively small histological samples such as obtained with non-invasive or minimally invasive techniques, facilitating a better phenotyping of lung ADC. Thus, current classification differentiates between preinvasive lesions (atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and in situ ADC), minimally invasive ADC (MIA) and invasive ADC. 'Field cancerization' is a concept that refers to progressive loco-regional changes occurring in tissues exposed to carcinogens, due to the interaction of the latter with a predisposing genetic background and an appropriate tissue microenvironment. Somatic genetic alterations, including mutations but also other changes, are necessary for oncogenesis, being especially frequent in lung ADC. Changes in the epidermal growth factor receptor (",

Five clones of DU145 and four clones of HT1080 cells were analyzed. We found from 7 to 12 unique SNVs between DU145 clones, while HT1080 clones showed no more than one unique SNV. We then sub-cloned individual cells from some of these isolated clones of DU145 and HT1080 cells. The sub-clones were expanded from a single cell to approximately one million cells after about 20 cell divisions. The sub-clones of DU145 cells had from one to four new unique SNVs within the sequenced regions. No unique SNVs were found between sub-clones of HT1080 cells.

			"abstract": "The AT-rich DNA is mostly associated with condensed chromatin, whereas the GC-rich sequence is preferably located in the dispersed chromatin. The AT-rich genes are prone to be tissue-specific (silenced in most tissues), while the GC-rich genes tend to be housekeeping (expressed in many tissues). This paper reports another important property of DNA base composition, which can affect repertoire of genes with high AT content. The GC-rich sequence is more liable to mutation. We found that Spearman correlation between human gene GC content and mutation probability is above 0.9. The change of base composition even in synonymous sites affects mutation probability of nonsynonymous sites and thus of encoded proteins. There is a unique type of housekeeping genes, which are especially unsafe when prone to mutation. Natural selection which usually removes deleterious mutations, in the case of these genes only increases the hazard because it can descend to suborganismal (cellular) level. These are cell cycle-related genes. In accordance with the proposed concept, they have low GC content of synonymous sites (despite them being housekeeping). The gene-centred protein interaction enrichment analysis (PIEA) showed the core clusters of genes whose interactants are modularly enriched in genes with AT-rich synonymous codons. This interconnected network is involved in double-strand break repair, DNA integrity checkpoints and chromosome pairing at mitosis. The damage of these genes results in genome and chromosome instability leading to cancer and other 'error catastrophes'. Reducing the nonsynonymous mutations, the usage of AT-rich synonymous codons can decrease probability of cancer by above 20-fold.",

Most differentiated thyroid tumors derived from thyroid epithelial cells exhibit slow-growing cancers, and patients with these tumors can achieve a good prognosis with surgical removal and radioiodine treatment. However, a small proportion of patients present with advanced thyroid cancer and are unusually resistant to current drug treatment modalities. Thyroid tumorigenesis is a complex process that is regulated by the activation of oncogenes, inactivation of tumor suppressors, and alterations in programmed cell death. Mitochondria play an essential role during tumor formation, progression, and metastasis of thyroid cancer.

			"abstract": "Cancer therapy agents have been used extensively as cytotoxic drugs against tissue or organ of a specific type of cancer. With the better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying carcinogenesis and cellular events during cancer progression and metastasis, it is now possible to use targeted therapy for these molecular events. Targeted therapy is able to identify cancer patients with dissimilar genetic defects at cellular level for the same cancer type and consequently requires individualized approach for treatment. Cancer therapy begins to shift steadily from the traditional approach of \"one regimen for all patients\" to a more individualized approach, through which each patient will be treated specifically according to their specific genetic defects. Personalized medicine accordingly requires identification of indicators or markers that guide in the decision making of such therapy to the chosen patients for more effective therapy. Cancer biomarkers are frequently used in clinical practice for diagnosis and prognosis, as well as identification of responsive patients and prediction of treatment response of cancer patient. The rapid breakthrough and development of microarray and sequencing technologies is probably the main tool for paving the way toward \"individualized biomarker-driven cancer therapy\" or \"personalized medicine\". In this review, we aim to provide an updated knowledge and overview of the current landscape of cancer biomarkers and their role in personalized medicine, emphasizing the impact of genomics on the implementation of new potential targeted therapies and development of novel cancer biomarkers in improving the outcome of cancer therapy.",

TOP2-induced DNA double-strand breaks are rejoined in part by tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (TDP2)-dependent non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), but whether this process suppresses or promotes TOP2-induced translocations is unclear. Here, we show that TDP2 rejoins DSBs induced during transcription-dependent TOP2 activity in breast cancer cells and at the translocation 'hotspot', MLL. Moreover, we find that TDP2 suppresses chromosome rearrangements induced by TOP2 and reduces TOP2-induced chromosome translocations that arise during gene transcription. Interestingly, however, we implicate TDP2-dependent NHEJ in the formation of a rare subclass of translocations associated previously with therapy-related leukemia and characterized by junction sequences with 4-bp of perfect homology. Collectively, these data highlight the threat posed by TOP2-induced DSBs during transcription and demonstrate the importance of TDP2-dependent non-homologous end-joining in protecting both gene transcription and genome stability.DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by topoisomerase II (TOP2) are rejoined by TDP2-dependent non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) but whether this promotes or suppresses translocations is not clear.

Here we introduce HIT'nDRIVE, a computational method that integrates genomic and transcriptomic data to identify a set of patient-specific, sequence-altered genes, with sufficient collective influence over dysregulated transcripts. HIT'nDRIVE aims to solve the \"random walk facility location\" (RWFL) problem in a gene (or protein) interaction network, which differs from the standard facility location problem by its use of an alternative distance measure: \"multihitting time,\" the expected length of the shortest random walk from any one of the set of sequence-altered genes to an expression-altered target gene. When applied to 2200 tumors from four major cancer types, HIT'nDRIVE revealed many potentially clinically actionable driver genes. We also demonstrated that it is possible to perform accurate phenotype prediction for tumor samples by only using HIT'nDRIVE-seeded driver gene modules from gene interaction networks. In addition, we identified a number of breast cancer subtype-specific driver modules that are associated with patients' survival outcome. Furthermore, HIT'nDRIVE, when applied to a large panel of pan-cancer cell lines, accurately predicted drug efficacy using the driver genes and their seeded gene modules. Overall, HIT'nDRIVE may help clinicians contextualize massive multiomics data in therapeutic decision making, enabling widespread implementation of precision oncology.",

			"abstract": "Cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality. The neoplastic transformation of normal cells to cancer cells is caused by a progressive accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations in oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes and epigenetic regulators, providing cells with new properties, collectively known as the hallmarks of cancer. During the process of neoplastic transformation cells progressively acquire novel characteristics such as unlimited growth potential, increased motility and the ability to migrate and invade adjacent tissues, the ability to spread from the tumor of origin to distant sites, and increased resistance to various types of stresses, mostly attributed to the activation of genetic stress-response programs. Accumulating evidence indicates a crucial role of microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) in the initiation and progression of cancer, acting either as oncogenes (oncomirs) or as tumor suppressors via several molecular mechanisms. MiRNAs comprise a class of small ~22\u00a0bp long noncoding RNAs that play a key role in the regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, acting as negative regulators of mRNA translation and/or stability. MiRNAs are involved in the regulation of a variety of biological processes including cell cycle progression, DNA damage responses and apoptosis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal cell transitions, cell motility and stemness through complex and interactive transcription factor-miRNA regulatory networks.",

Intriguingly, some of the effects appear to differ between soma and germline: in particular, whereas mutation rates have been reported to decrease with expression levels in tumors, no clear effect has been detected in the germline. Distinct approaches were taken to analyze the data, however, so it is hard to know whether these apparent differences are real. To enable a cleaner comparison, we considered a statistical model in which the mutation rate of a coding region is predicted by GC content, expression levels, replication timing, and two histone repressive marks. We applied this model to both a set of germline mutations identified in exomes and to exonic somatic mutations in four types of tumors. Most determinants of mutations are shared: notably, we detected an effect of expression levels on both germline and somatic mutation rates. Moreover, in all tissues considered, higher expression levels are associated with greater strand asymmetry of mutations. However, mutation rates increase with expression levels in testis (and, more tentatively, in ovary), whereas they decrease with expression levels in somatic tissues. This contrast points to differences in damage or repair rates during transcription in soma and germline.",

Precision strategies for drug development and patient stratification, based on the molecular features of tumors, are the next logical step in a long history of approaches to cancer therapy. In this review, we discuss the history of cancer treatment from generic natural extracts and radical surgical procedures to site-specific and combinatorial treatment regimens, which have incrementally improved patient outcomes. We discuss the related contributions of genetics and epigenetics to cancer progression and the response to targeted therapies and identify challenges and opportunities for the success of precision medicine. The identification of patients who will benefit from targeted therapies is more complex than simply identifying patients whose tumors harbour the targeted aberration, and intratumoral heterogeneity makes it difficult to determine if a precision therapy is successful during treatment. This heterogeneity enables tumors to develop resistance to targeted approaches; therefore, the rational combination of therapeutic agents will limit the threat of acquired resistance to therapeutic success. By incorporating the view of malignant transformation modulated by networks of genetic and epigenetic interactions, molecular strategies will enable precision medicine for effective treatment across cancer subtypes.",

			"abstract": "Cancer is the most challenging disease of our time with increasing numbers of new cases each year, worldwide. Great achievements have been reached in cancer research through deep sequencing which helped define druggable targets. However, the still-evolving targeted therapy suffers resistance suggesting that DNA mutations considered as drivers may not have a role in tumor initiation. The present work discusses the role of DNA mutations as drivers and passengers in cancer initiation and development. First, it is important to discern the role of these DNA mutations as initiating events causing cancer or as contributors crucial for the development of a tumor once it has initiated. Second, breast cancer shown here illustrates how identification of DNA mutations in cancerous cells has influenced our approach for anti-cancer drug design. The cancer trilogy we have reached and described as: initial drug; resistance/recurrence; drug/treatment combinations, calls for a paradigm shift. To design more effective cancer drugs with durable and positive outcome, future cancer research needs to move beyond the sequencing era and explore changes which are taking place in cancer cells at levels other than the DNA. Evolutionary constraints may be acting as a barrier to preserve the human species from being transformed and, for that matter, all multi-cellular species which can incur cancer. Furthermore, mutations in the DNA do occur and for a multitude of reasons but without necessarily causing cancer. New directions will draw themselves when more focus is given to the event responsible for the switch of a cell from normalcy to malignancy. Until then, targeted therapy will certainly continue to improve the outcome of patients; however, it is unlikely to eradicate breast cancer depicted here.",

The acquisition of clonal hematopoiesis-driver mutations (CHDMs) occurs with normal aging and these mutations have been detected in more than 10% of individuals \u226565 years. We aimed to examine the prevalence and characteristics of CHDMs throughout adult life. We developed a targeted re-sequencing assay combining high-throughput with ultra-high sensitivity based on single-molecule molecular inversion probes (smMIPs). Using smMIPs, we screened more than 100 loci for CHDMs in more than 2,000 blood DNA samples from population controls between 20 and 69 years of age. Loci screened included 40 regions known to drive clonal hematopoiesis when mutated and 64 novel candidate loci. We identified 224 somatic mutations throughout our cohort, of which 216 were coding mutations in known driver genes (DNMT3A, JAK2, GNAS, TET2, and ASXL1), including 196 point mutations and 20 indels. Our assay's improved sensitivity allowed us to detect mutations with variant allele frequencies as low as 0.001. CHDMs were identified in more than 20% of individuals 60 to 69 years of age and in 3% of individuals 20 to 29 years of age, approximately double the previously reported prevalence despite screening a limited set of loci. Our findings support the occurrence of clonal hematopoiesis-associated mutations as a widespread mechanism linked with aging, suggesting that mosaicism as a result of clonal evolution of cells harboring somatic mutations is a universal mechanism occurring at all ages in healthy humans.",

Here we propose a method, NetNorM, to represent whole-exome somatic mutation data in a form that enhances cancer-relevant information using a gene network as background knowledge. We evaluate its relevance for two tasks: survival prediction and unsupervised patient stratification. Using data from 8 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we show that it improves over the raw binary mutation data and network diffusion for these two tasks.

			"abstract": "Therapies targeting epigenetic changes for cancer treatment are in Phase I/II trials; however, all of these target\u00a0only nuclear DNA. Emerging evidence suggests presence of methylation marks on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA); but their contribution in cancer is unidentified. Expression of genes encoded on mtDNA are altered in cancer cells, along with increased glycolytic flux. Such glycolytic flux and elevated reactive oxygen species is supported by increased antioxidant; glutathione. MicroRNA-34a can translocate to mitochondria, mediate downstream apoptotic effects of tumor suppressor P53, and inhibit the antioxidant response element Nrf-2, resulting in depleted glutathione levels. Based on such strong rationale, we encapsulated microRNA-34a in our well-established Hyaluronic-Acid nanoparticles and delivered to cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant A549-lung adenocarcinoma cells. Successful delivery and uptake in cells resulted in altered ATP levels, decreased glycolytic flux, Nrf-2 and glutathione levels, ultimately resulting in caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. Most important were the concurrent underlying molecular changes in epigenetic status of D-loop on the mtDNA and transcription of mtDNA-encoded genes. Although preliminary, we provide a novel therapeutic approach in form of altered mitochondrial bioenergetics and redox status of cancer cells with underlying changes in epigenetic status of mtDNA that can subsequently results in induction of cancer cell apoptosis.",

			"abstract": "A breast cancer genome is a record of the historic mutagenic activity that has occurred throughout the development of the tumor. Indeed, every mutation may be informative. Although driver mutations were the main focus of cancer research for a long time, passenger mutational signatures, the imprints of DNA damage and DNA repair processes that have been operative during tumorigenesis, are also biologically illuminating. This review is a chronicle of how the concept of mutational signatures arose and brings the reader up-to-date on this field, particularly in breast cancer. Mutational signatures have now been advanced to include mutational processes that involve rearrangements, and novel cancer biological insights have been gained through studying these in great detail. Furthermore, there are efforts to take this field into the clinical sphere. If validated, mutational signatures could thus form an additional weapon in the arsenal of cancer precision diagnostics and therapeutic stratification in the modern war against cancer. ",

However, compared to whole genome sequencing, WES introduces more biases and noise that make CNV detection very challenging.

			"abstract": "Cancer is a genetic disorder, meaning that a plethora of different mutations, whether somatic or germ line, underlie the etiology of the 'Emperor of Maladies'. Point mutations, chromosomal rearrangements and copy number changes, whether they have occurred spontaneously in predisposed individuals or have been induced by intrinsic or extrinsic (environmental) mutagens, lead to the activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, thereby promoting malignancy. This scenario has now been recognized and experimentally confirmed in a wide range of different contexts. Over the past decade, a surge in available sequencing technologies has allowed the sequencing of whole genomes from liquid malignancies and solid tumors belonging to different types and stages of cancer, giving birth to the new field of cancer genomics. One of the most striking discoveries has been that cancer genomes are highly enriched with mutations of specific kinds. It has been suggested that these mutations can be classified into 'families' based on their mutational signatures. A mutational signature may be regarded as a type of base substitution (e.g. C:G to T:A) within a particular context of neighboring nucleotide sequence (the bases upstream and/or downstream of the mutation). These mutational signatures, supplemented by mutable motifs (a wider mutational context), promise to help us to understand the nature of the mutational processes that operate during tumor evolution because they represent the footprints of interactions between DNA, mutagens and the enzymes of the repair/replication/modification pathways.",

Dry seeds of chickpea were treated with GSM cell phone (900\u00a0MHz) and laptop (3.31\u00a0GHz) as RF source for 24 and 48\u00a0h. Untreated seeds were used as (0\u00a0h) negative control and Gamma rays (250 Gray) as positive control. Plant chromosomal aberration assay was used as genotoxicity marker. All the treatment of RF inhibits seed germination percentage. 48\u00a0h laptop treatment has the most negative effect as compared to untreated control. A decrease was observed in mitotic index (M.I) and increase in abnormality index (A.I) with the increase in exposure duration and frequency in (Hz). Cell membrane damages were also observed only in 48\u00a0h exposure of cell phone and laptop (RF). Maximum nuclear membrane damages and ghost cells were again recorded in 48\u00a0h exposure of cell phone and laptop. The radiofrequency radiations (900\u00a0MHz and 3.31\u00a0GHz) are only genotoxic as they induce micronuclei, bi-nuclei, multi-nuclei and scattered nuclei but could be carcinogenic as 48\u00a0h incubation of RF induced fragmentation and ghost cells. Therefore cell phones and laptop should not be used unnecessarily to avoid possible genotoxic and carcinogenic effects.",

Using consensus clustering method, we characterized ten clusters with distinct transcriptional response patterns and enriched pathways. Notably, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma was divided in two subtypes, enriched in cell cycle-related pathways and cell adhesion-related pathways respectively. The other interesting result is that we identified 92 potential pan-cancer genes that were consistently upregulated across multiple cancer types. Knockdown of FAM64A or TROAP inhibited the growth of cancer cells, suggesting that these genes may promote tumor development and are worthy of further validations.

In normal cells, such metabolic stress leads to inhibition of signaling through the mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1), reduction of protein translation, cell cycle arrest, and conservation of energy. In contrast, negative regulation of mTORC1 signaling by DNA damage is abrogated in many cancer cells, thus mTORC1 signaling remains active under microenvironmental conditions that potentially promote endogenous DNA damage. Here we report that mTORC1 signaling suppresses endogenous DNA damage and replication stress. Pharmacological inhibition of mTOR signaling resulted in phosphorylation of H2AX concomitant with the decrease of CHK1 levels both in cell culture and mouse rhadomyosarcoma xenografts. Further results demonstrated that mTORC1-S6K1 signaling controls transcription of CHK1 via Rb-E2F by upregulating cyclin D and E. Consistent with these results, downregulation of CHK1 by inhibition of mTOR kinase resulted in defects in the slow S phase progression following DNA damage. These results indicate that, under stressful conditions, maintained mTORC1 signaling in cancer cells promotes survival by suppressing endogenous DNA damage, and may control cell fate through the regulation of CHK1.",

The mRNASeq data of PRCC and adjacent normal tissue in The Cancer Genome Atlas was analyzed to identify 1148 differentially expressed genes, on which weighted gene co-expression network analysis was performed. Then 11 co-expressed gene modules were identified. The highest association was found between blue module and pathological stage (r = 0.45) by Pearson's correlation analysis. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that biological processes of blue module focused on nuclear division, cell cycle phase, and spindle (all P < 1e-10). All 40 hub genes in blue module can distinguish localized (pathological stage I, II) from non-localized (pathological stage III, IV) PRCC (P < 0.01). A good molecular biomarker for pathological stage of RCC must be a prognostic gene in clinical practice. Survival analysis was performed to reversely validate if hub genes were associated with pathological stage. Survival analysis unveiled that all hub genes were associated with patient prognosis (P < 0.01).The validation cohort GSE2748 verified that 30 hub genes can differentiate localized from non-localized PRCC (P < 0.01), and 18 hub genes are prognosis-associated (P < 0.01).ROC curve indicated that the 17 hub genes exhibited excellent diagnostic efficiency for localized and non-localized PRCC (AUC > 0.7).

			"abstract": "The fight against cancer is hindered by its highly heterogeneous nature. Genome-wide sequencing studies have shown that individual malignancies contain many mutations that range from those commonly found in tumor genomes to rare somatic variants present only in a small fraction of lesions. Such rare somatic variants dominate the landscape of genomic mutations in cancer, yet efforts to correlate somatic mutations found in one or few individuals with functional roles have been largely unsuccessful. Traditional methods for identifying somatic variants that drive cancer are 'gene-centric' in that they consider only somatic variants within a particular gene and make no comparison to other similar genes in the same family that may play a similar role in cancer. In this work, we present oncodomain hotspots, a new 'domain-centric' method for identifying clusters of somatic mutations across entire gene families using protein domain models. Our analysis confirms that our approach creates a framework for leveraging structural and functional information encapsulated by protein domains into the analysis of somatic variants in cancer, enabling the assessment of even rare somatic variants by comparison to similar genes. Our results reveal a vast landscape of somatic variants that act at the level of domain families altering pathways known to be involved with cancer such as protein phosphorylation, signaling, gene regulation, and cell metabolism. Due to oncodomain hotspots' unique ability to assess rare variants, we expect our method to become an important tool for the analysis of sequenced tumor genomes, complementing existing methods.",

Deregulation of these epitranscriptomic events contributes to CSC generation and maintenance, which governs cancer progression and drug resistance. In this Review, we discuss the role of malignant RNA processing in CSC generation and maintenance, including mechanisms of RNA methylation, RNA editing and RNA splicing, and the functional consequences of their aberrant regulation in human malignancies.

			"abstract": "The identification of mutations that are present at low frequencies in clinical samples is an essential component of precision medicine. The development of molecular barcoding for next-generation sequencing has greatly enhanced the sensitivity of detecting such mutations by massively parallel sequencing. However, further improvements in specificity would be useful for a variety of applications. We herein describe a technology (BiSeqS) that can increase the specificity of sequencing by at least two orders of magnitude over and above that achieved with molecular barcoding and can be applied to any massively parallel sequencing instrument. BiSeqS employs bisulfite treatment to distinguish the two strands of molecularly barcoded DNA; its specificity arises from the requirement for the same mutation to be identified in both strands. Because no library preparation is required, the technology permits very efficient use of the template DNA as well as sequence reads, which are nearly all confined to the amplicons of interest. Such efficiency is critical for clinical samples, such as plasma, in which only tiny amounts of DNA are often available. We show here that BiSeqS can be applied to evaluate transversions, as well as small insertions or deletions, and can reliably detect one mutation among >10,000 wild-type molecules.",

			"abstract": "Cancer is a multifactorial disease driven by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Many cancer driver mutations have been characterised in protein-coding regions of the genome. However, mutations in noncoding regions associated with cancer have been less investigated. G-quadruplex (G4) nucleic acids are four-stranded secondary structures formed in guanine-rich sequences and prevalent in the regulatory regions. In this study, we used published whole cancer genome sequence data to find mutations in cancer patients that overlap potential RNA G4-forming sequences in 5' UTRs. Using RNAfold, we assessed the effect of these mutations on the thermodynamic stability of predicted RNA G4s in the context of full-length 5' UTRs. Of the 217 identified mutations, we found that 33 are predicted to destabilise and 21 predicted to stabilise potential RNA G4s. We experimentally validated the effect of destabilising mutations in the 5' UTRs of BCL2 and CXCL14 and one stabilising mutation in the 5' UTR of TAOK2. These mutations resulted in an increase or a decrease in translation of these mRNAs, respectively. These findings suggest that mutations that modulate the G4 stability in the noncoding regions could act as cancer driver mutations, which present an opportunity for early cancer diagnosis using individual sequencing information.",

As tumors shed parts of themselves into the circulation, analyses of circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA, and tumor-derived exosomes, often referred to as \"liquid biopsies\", may enable tumor genome characterization by minimally invasive means. Indeed, multiple studies have described how molecular information about parent tumors can be extracted from these components.

We address normal and detectable mutation levels in the context of our current knowledge regarding the gradual accumulation of mutations during aging and in light of technological limitations.

In this Review, we discuss the current understanding of cancer genetic variants, including the broad spectrum of mutation classes and the wide range of mechanistic effects on gene function in the context of signalling networks. We highlight recent advances in computational and experimental strategies to study the diverse functional and phenotypic consequences of mutations at the base-pair resolution.

The major role of R mutations in cancer etiology was supported by an independent approach, based solely on cancer genome sequencing and epidemiological data, which suggested that R mutations are responsible for two-thirds of the mutations in human cancers.

			"abstract": "Evidence that noncoding mutation can result in cancer driver events is mounting. However, it is more difficult to assign molecular biological consequences to noncoding mutations than to coding mutations, and a typical cancer genome contains many more noncoding mutations than protein-coding mutations. Accordingly, parsing functional noncoding mutation signal from noise remains an important challenge. Here we use an empirical approach to identify putatively functional noncoding somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) from liver cancer genomes. Annotation of candidate variants by publicly available epigenome datasets finds that 40.5% of SNVs fall in regulatory elements. When assigned to specific regulatory elements, we find that the distribution of regulatory element mutation mirrors that of nonsynonymous coding mutation, where few regulatory elements are recurrently mutated in a patient population but many are singly mutated. We find potential gain-of-binding site events among candidate SNVs, suggesting a mechanism of action for these variants. When aggregating noncoding somatic mutation in promoters, we find that genes in the ERBB signaling and MAPK signaling pathways are significantly enriched for promoter mutations. Altogether, our results suggest that functional somatic SNVs in cancer are sporadic, but occasionally occur in regulatory elements and may affect phenotype by creating binding sites for transcriptional regulators. Accordingly, we propose that noncoding mutation should be formally accounted for when determining gene- and pathway-mutation burden in cancer.",

			"abstract": "Pediatric cancers differ from adult tumors, especially by their very low mutational rate. Therefore, their etiology could be explained in part by other oncogenic mechanisms such as chromosomal rearrangements, supporting the possible implication of fusion genes in the development of pediatric cancers. Fusion genes result from chromosomal rearrangements leading to the juxtaposition of two genes. Consequently, an abnormal activation of one or both genes is observed. The detection of fusion genes has generated great interest in basic cancer research and in the clinical setting, since these genes can lead to better comprehension of the biological mechanisms of tumorigenesis and they can also be used as therapeutic targets and diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms of fusion genes and their particularities in pediatric cancers, as well as their relevance in murine models and in the clinical setting. We also point out the difficulties encountered in the discovery of fusion genes. Finally, we discuss future perspectives and priorities for finding new innovative therapies in childhood cancer.",

We found that B-Myb (encoded by MYBL2) binds the A3B promoter, causing transactivation, and this is responsible for the C-to-T transitions and DNA hypermutation in breast cancer cells. Analysis of TCGA database yielded similar results, supporting that MYBL2 and A3B are upregulated and putatively promote C-to-T transitions in multiple cancer types. Moreover, blockade of EGF receptor with afatinib attenuated B-Myb-A3B signaling, suggesting a clinically relevant means of suppressing mutagenesis.

We describe the principles that underlie subclonal reconstruction through single nucleotide variants (SNVs) or copy number alterations (CNAs) from bulk or single-cell sequencing. These principles include estimating the fraction of tumor cells for SNVs and CNAs, performing clustering of SNVs from single- and multisample cases, and single-cell sequencing. The application of subclonal reconstruction methods is providing key insights into tumor evolution, identifying subclonal driver mutations, patterns of parallel evolution and differences in mutational signatures between cellular populations, and characterizing the mechanisms of therapy resistance, spread, and metastasis.",

			"abstract": "c-Myc dysregulation is hypothesized to account for the 'stemness' - self-renewal and pluripotency - shared between embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and adult aggressive tumours. High-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NB) is the most frequent, aggressive, extracranial solid tumour in childhood. Using HR-NB as a platform, we performed a network analysis of transcriptome data and presented a c-Myc subnetwork enriched for genes previously reported as ESC-like cancer signatures. A subsequent drug-gene interaction analysis identified a pharmacogenomic agent that preferentially interacted with this HR-NB-specific, ESC-like signature. This agent, Roniciclib (BAY 1000394), inhibited neuroblastoma cell growth and induced apoptosis in vitro. It also repressed the expression of the oncogene c-Myc and the neural ESC marker CDK2 in vitro, which was accompanied by altered expression of the c-Myc-targeted cell cycle regulators CCND1, CDKN1A and CDKN2D in a time-dependent manner. Further investigation into this HR-NB-specific ESC-like signature in 295 and 243 independent patients revealed and validated the general prognostic index of CDK2 and CDKN3 compared with CDKN2D and CDKN1B. These findings highlight the very potent therapeutic benefits of Roniciclib in HR-NB through the targeting of c-Myc-regulated, ESC-like tumorigenesis. This work provides a hypothesis-driven systems computational model that facilitates the translation of genomic and transcriptomic signatures to molecular mechanisms underlying high-risk tumours.",

However, systematically investigating commonalities and specificities of driver gene sets among multiple cancer types is still a great challenge, but this investigation will undoubtedly benefit deciphering cancers and will be helpful for personalized therapy and precision medicine in cancer treatment. In this study, we propose two optimization models to de novo discover common driver gene sets among multiple cancer types (ComMDP) and specific driver gene sets of one certain or multiple cancer types to other cancers (SpeMDP), respectively. We first apply ComMDP and SpeMDP to simulated data to validate their efficiency. Then, we further apply these methods to 12 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and obtain several biologically meaningful driver pathways. As examples, we construct a common cancer pathway model for BRCA and OV, infer a complex driver pathway model for BRCA carcinogenesis based on common driver gene sets of BRCA with eight cancer types, and investigate specific driver pathways of the liquid cancer lymphoblastic acute myeloid leukemia (LAML) versus other solid cancer types.

			"abstract": "By the time the process of oncogenesis has produced an advanced cancer, tumor cells have undergone extensive evolution. The cellular phenotypes resulting from this evolution have been well studied, and include accelerated growth rates, apoptosis resistance, immortality, invasiveness, and immune evasion. Yet with all of our current knowledge of tumor biology, the details of early oncogenesis have been difficult to observe and understand. Where different oncogenic mutations may work together to enhance the survival of a tumor cell, in isolation they are often pro-apoptotic, pro-differentiative or pro-senescent, and therefore often, somewhat paradoxically, disadvantageous to a cell. It is also becoming clear that somatic mutations, including those in known oncogenic drivers, are common in tissues starting at a young age. These observations raise the question: how do we largely avoid cancer for most of our lives? Here we propose that evolutionary forces can help explain this paradox. As humans and other organisms age or experience external insults such as radiation or smoking, the structure and function of tissues progressively degrade, resulting in altered stem cell niche microenvironments. As tissue integrity declines, it becomes less capable of supporting and maintaining resident stem cells. These stem cells then find themselves in a microenvironment to which they are poorly adapted, providing a competitive advantage to those cells that can restore their functionality and fitness through mutations or epigenetic changes. The resulting oncogenic clonal expansions then increase the odds of further cancer progression. Understanding how the causes of cancer, such as aging or smoking, affect tissue microenvironments to control the impact of mutations on somatic cell fitness can help reconcile the discrepancy between marked mutation accumulation starting early in life and the somatic evolution that leads to cancer at advanced ages or following carcinogenic insults.

			"abstract": "Cancer complexome comprises a heterogeneous and multifactorial milieu that varies in cytology, physiology, signaling mechanisms and response to therapy. The combined framework of network theory and spectral graph theory along with the multilayer analysis provides a comprehensive approach to analyze the proteomic data of seven different cancers, namely, breast, oral, ovarian, cervical, lung, colon and prostate. Our analysis demonstrates that the protein-protein interaction networks of the normal and the cancerous tissues associated with the seven cancers have overall similar structural and spectral properties. However, few of these properties implicate unsystematic changes from the normal to the disease networks depicting difference in the interactions and highlighting changes in the complexity of different cancers. Importantly, analysis of common proteins of all the cancer networks reveals few proteins namely the sensors, which not only occupy significant position in all the layers but also have direct involvement in causing cancer. The prediction and analysis of miRNAs targeting these sensor proteins hint towards the possible role of these proteins in tumorigenesis. This novel approach helps in understanding cancer at the fundamental level and provides a clue to develop promising and nascent concept of single drug therapy for multiple diseases as well as personalized medicine.",

			"abstract": "Somatic mutation in human epidermal growth factor receptor-related 2 gene (HER2) is one of the driver mutations in lung cancer. HER2 mutations are found in about 2% of lung adenocarcinomas (ADCs). Previous reports have been based mainly on diagnostic screening by Sanger sequencing or next-generation sequencing (NGS); however, these methods are time-consuming and complicated. We developed a rapid, simple, sensitive mutation detection assay for detecting HER2 12 base pair-duplicated insertion mutation based on the Eprobe-mediated PCR method (Eprobe-PCR) and validated the sensitivity of this assay system for clinical diagnostics. We examined 635 tumor samples and analyzed HER2 mutations using the Eprobe-PCR method, NGS, and Sanger sequencing. In a serial dilution study, the Eprobe-PCR was able to detect mutant plasmid DNA when its concentration was reduced to 0.1% by mixing with wild-type DNA. We also confirmed amplification of the mutated plasmid DNA with only 10 copies per reaction. In ADCs, Eprobe-PCR detected the HER2 mutation in 2.02% (9/446), while Sanger sequencing detected it in 1.57% (7/446). Eprobe-PCR was able to detect the mutation in two samples that were undetectable by Sanger sequencing. All non-ADC samples were wild-type. There were no discrepancies between frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues in the nine samples. HER2 mutations detected by NGS data validated the high sensitivity of the method. Therefore, this new technique can lead to precise molecular-targeted therapies.",

Of 105 useable responses, 86.7% of GCs reported their institutions were using TP, although only 6.7% did this routinely. Although 63.7% reported personal involvement in the process, largely with result interpretation and follow-up germline testing, 69.7% reported seeing fewer than 5 patients for this reason and 97.9% desired further education on this topic. Work and regional setting were not predictors of involvement with TP; however, GCs in the academic setting were less aware of who obtains consent (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). GCs reported they were not often utilized as a resource regarding TP. Overall, GCs believed TP is beneficial in identifying hereditary cancer syndromes, although most reported finding a germline mutation in <10% of cases. This study provides a snapshot of current GC involvement with TP, and documents the desire by GCs for additional education on tumor profiling.",

While the landscape of coding drivers has been extensively studied and many of the most prominent driver genes are well characterised, comparatively less is known about the role of mutations in the non-coding regions of the genome in cancer development. The continuing fall in genome sequencing costs has resulted in a concomitant increase in the number of cancer whole genome sequences being produced, facilitating systematic interrogation of both the coding and non-coding regions of cancer genomes.",

Four SNVs located at 5q11.2 were found to be associated with the somatic PIK3CA variant status in the pilot cohort of 77 cases with odds ratio (OR) up to 6.5 indicating strong effects, and were selected for the validation phase. Two of these SNVs, rs252913 and rs331499, located in the MAP3K1/SETD9 gene boundary, were confirmed to be associated with somatic PIK3CA variants in the large cohort with OR 2.97 (1.17-7.75) and 1.76 (1.11-2.77), respectively, notably higher than their BC risk-associated values, both around 1.1.

Indeed, TE insertion mutations have been implicated in the etiology of a number of different cancer types.

Recent developments in bioinformatics software make it possible to analyze TE expression levels and TE insertional activity directly from transcriptome (RNA-seq) and whole genome (DNA-seq) next-generation sequence data. We applied these new sequence analysis techniques to matched normal and primary tumor patient samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) in order to analyze the patterns of TE expression and insertion for three cancer types: breast invasive carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma. Our analysis focused on the three most abundant families of active human TEs: Alu, SVA, and L1. We found evidence for high levels of somatic TE activity for these three families in normal and cancer samples across diverse tissue types. Abundant transcripts for all three TE families were detected in both normal and cancer tissues along with an average of ~80 unique TE insertions per individual patient/tissue. We observed an increase in L1 transcript expression and L1 insertional activity in primary tumor samples for all three cancer types. Tumor-specific TE insertions are enriched for private mutations, consistent with a potentially causal role in tumorigenesis.

The main objective of our study was to explore the evolution of the microbiota community and molecules related with CRC in the dynamic transition from normal colon epithelium to premalignant adenoma with the aid of an 'adenoma-carcinoma sequence' mouse CRC model induced by DMH. We generated a modified mouse CRC model induced by DMH for DNA sequences, and characterized the molecular networks. Data from 454 pyrosequencing of the V3- V5 region of the 16S rDNA gene and immunohistochemical detection of APC, P53, K-RAS and BRAF genes were assessed with Principal coordinates, UniFrac, and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test. The inflammatory group showed enrichment of Bacteroidetes and Porphyromonadaceae (P < 0.01). OTUs affiliated with Firmicutes were enriched in the hyperproliferative group (P < 0.01). Rikenellaceae and Ruminococcaceae showed an increasing trend during the CRC process while the opposite pattern was observed for Prevotellaceaeand Enterobacteriaceae. OTUs related to Alistipes finegoldii were significantly increased during CRC development, P53, K-RAS and BRAF, were gradually increased (P < 0.05). Conversely, expression of APC was decreased during the course of development of CRC. Our results demonstrate that the biological evolutionary shift of gut microbiota, characterized by a gradual decrease in 'driver' bacteria and an increase in DNA damage-causing bacteria, is accompanied by tumor development in the CRC model. The synergistic actions of microbiota dysbiosis and effects of bacterial metabolites on related molecular events are proposed to contribute to the progression of CRC tumorigenesis.",

The four tools returned poor consensus on candidates (only 20% of calls were with multiple hits by the callers). For both WES and UDT-Seq, MuTect2 and Strelka obtained the largest proportion of COSMIC entries as well as the lowest rate of dbSNP presence and high-alternative-alleles-in-control calls, demonstrating their superior sensitivity and accuracy. Combining different callers does increase reliability of candidates, but narrows the list down to very limited range of tumor read depth and variant allele frequency. Calling SNV on UDT-Seq data, which were of much higher read-depth, discovered additional true-positive variations, despite an even more tremendous growth in false positive predictions. Our findings not only provide valuable benchmark for state-of-the-art SNV calling methods, but also shed light on the access to more accurate SNV identification in the future.",

Methods in the first two categories use and integrate different types of data, such as biological pathways, protein interaction networks, and gene expression measurements. The third category consists of de novo methods that detect combinatorial patterns of somatic mutations across tumor samples, such as mutual exclusivity and co-occurrence. In this review, we discuss recent advances, current limitations, and future challenges of these approaches for detecting cancer genes and pathways. We also discuss the most important current resources of cancer-related genes.

			"abstract": "Mutations of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 genes occur in ~80% of lower-grade (WHO grade II and grade III) gliomas. Mutant IDH produces (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate, which induces DNA hypermethylation and presumably drives tumorigenesis. Interestingly, IDH mutations are associated with improved survival in glioma patients, but the underlying mechanism for the difference in survival remains unclear. Through comparative analyses of 286 cases of IDH-wildtype and IDH-mutant lower-grade glioma from a TCGA data set, we report that IDH-mutant gliomas have increased expression of tumor-suppressor genes (NF1, PTEN, and PIK3R1) and decreased expression of oncogenes(AKT2, ARAF, ERBB2, FGFR3, and PDGFRB) and glioma progression genes (FOXM1, IGFBP2, and WWTR1) compared with IDH-wildtype gliomas. Furthermore, each of these genes is prognostic in overall gliomas; however, within the IDH-mutant group, none remains prognostic except IGFBP2 (encodinginsulin-like growth factor binding protein 2). Through validation in an independent cohort, we show that patients with low IGFBP2 expressiondisplay a clear advantage in overall and disease-free survival, whereas those with high IGFBP2 expressionhave worse median survival than IDH-wildtype patients. These observations hold true across different histological and molecular subtypes of lower-grade glioma. We propose therefore that an unexpected biological consequence of IDH mutations in glioma is to ameliorate patient survival by promoting tumor-suppressor signaling while inhibiting that of oncogenes, particularly IGFBP2.",

			"abstract": "The rise of genomically targeted therapies and immunotherapy has revolutionized the practice of oncology in the last 10-15 years. At the same time, new technologies and the electronic health record (EHR) in particular have permeated the oncology clinic. Initially designed as billing and clinical documentation systems, EHR systems have not anticipated the complexity and variety of genomic information that needs to be reviewed, interpreted, and acted upon on a daily basis. Improved integration of cancer genomic data with EHR systems will help guide clinician decision making, support secondary uses, and ultimately improve patient care within oncology clinics. Some of the key factors relating to the challenge of integrating cancer genomic data into EHRs include: the bioinformatics pipelines that translate raw genomic data into meaningful, actionable results; the role of human curation in the interpretation of variant calls; and the need for consistent standards with regard to genomic and clinical data. Several emerging paradigms for integration are discussed in this review, including: non-standardized efforts between individual institutions and genomic testing laboratories; \"middleware\" products that portray genomic information, albeit outside of the clinical workflow; and application programming interfaces that have the potential to work within clinical workflow. The critical need for clinical-genomic knowledge bases, which can be independent or integrated into the aforementioned solutions, is also discussed.",

			"abstract": "Many disciplines, from human genetics and oncology to plant breeding, microbiology and virology, commonly face the challenge of analyzing rapidly increasing numbers of genomes. In case of Homo sapiens, the number of sequenced genomes will approach hundreds of thousands in the next few years. Simply scaling up established bioinformatics pipelines will not be sufficient for leveraging the full potential of such rich genomic data sets. Instead, novel, qualitatively different computational methods and paradigms are needed. We will witness the rapid extension of computational pan-genomics, a new sub-area of research in computational biology. In this article, we generalize existing definitions and understand a pan-genome as any collection of genomic sequences to be analyzed jointly or to be used as a reference. We examine already available approaches to construct and use pan-genomes, discuss the potential benefits of future technologies and methodologies and review open challenges from the vantage point of the above-mentioned biological disciplines. As a prominent example for a computational paradigm shift, we particularly highlight the transition from the representation of reference genomes as strings to representations as graphs. We outline how this and other challenges from different application domains translate into common computational problems, point out relevant bioinformatics techniques and identify open problems in computer science. With this review, we aim to increase awareness that a joint approach to computational pan-genomics can help address many of the problems currently faced in various domains.",

			"abstract": "Osteosarcoma is the predominant form of bone cancer, affecting mostly adolescents. Recent progress made in molecular genetic studies of osteosarcoma has changed our view on the cause of the disease and ongoing therapeutic approaches for patients. As we draw closer to gaining more complete catalogs of candidate cancer driver genes in common forms of cancer, the landscape of somatic mutations in osteosarcoma is emerging from its first phase. In this review, we summarize recent whole genome and/or whole exome genomic studies, and then put these findings in the context of genetic hallmarks of somatic mutations and mutational processes in human osteosarcoma. One of the lessons learned here is that the extent of somatic mutations and complexity of the osteosarcoma genome are similar to that of common forms of adult cancer. Thus, a much higher number of samples than those currently obtained are needed to complete the catalog of driver mutations in human osteosarcoma. In parallel, genetic studies in other species have revealed candidate driver genes and their roles in the genesis of osteosarcoma. This review also summarizes newly identified drivers in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) and discusses our understanding of the impact of nature and number of drivers on tumor latency, subtypes, and metastatic potentials of osteosarcoma. It is becoming apparent that a synergistic team composed of three drivers (one 'first driver' and two 'synergistic drivers') may be required to generate an animal model that recapitulates aggressive osteosarcoma with a short latency. Finally, new cancer therapies are urgently needed to improve survival rate and quality of life for osteosarcoma patients. Several vulnerabilities in osteosarcoma are illustrated in this review to exemplify the opportunities for next generation molecularly targeted therapies. However, much work remains in order to complete our understanding of the somatic mutation basis of osteosarcoma, to develop reliable animal models of human disease, and to apply this information to guide new therapeutic approaches for reducing morbidity and mortality of this rare disease.",

To date, limited genetic analyses confirmed KIT mutations as a recurrent genetic event similar to other mucosal melanomas, occurring in up to 30% of anorectal melanomas. Importantly, a subset of tumors harboring activating KIT mutations have been found to respond to c-Kit inhibitor-based therapy, with improved patient survival at advanced tumor stages. We performed comprehensive targeted exon sequencing analysis of 467 cancer-related genes in a larger series of 15 anorectal melanomas, focusing on potentially actionable variants based on gain- and loss-of-function mutations. We report the identification of oncogenic driver events in the majority (93%) of anorectal melanomas. These included variants in canonical MAPK pathway effectors rarely observed in cutaneous melanomas (including an HRAS mutation, as well as a BRAF mutation resulting in duplication of threonine 599), and recurrent mutations in the tumor suppressor NF1 in 20% of cases, which represented the second-most frequently mutated gene after KIT in our series. Furthermore, we identify SF3B1 mutations as a recurrent genetic event in mucosal melanomas. Our findings provide an insight into the genetic diversity of anorectal melanomas, and suggest significant potential for alternative targeted therapeutics in addition to c-Kit inhibitors for this melanoma subtype.",

Here, associations between genomic aberrations and disease recurrence in stage II and III colon cancers were investigated. A series of 114 stage II and III microsatellite stable colon cancer samples were analyzed by high-resolution array-comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) to detect CNAs and CNA-associated chromosomal breakpoints (SVs). For 60 of these samples mutation status of APC, TP53, KRAS, PIK3CA, FBXW7, SMAD4, BRAF and NRAS was determined using targeted massive parallel sequencing. Loss of chromosome 18q12.1-18q12.2 occurred more frequently in tumors that relapsed than in relapse-free tumors (p < 0.001; FDR = 0.13). In total, 267 genes were recurrently affected by SVs (FDR < 0.1). CNAs and SVs were not associated with disease-free survival (DFS). Mutations in APC and TP53 were associated with increased CNAs. APC mutations were associated with poor prognosis in (5-fluorouracil treated) stage III colon cancers (p = 0.005; HR = 4.1), an effect that was further enhanced by mutations in MAPK pathway (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF) genes. We conclude that among multiple genomic alterations in CRC, strongest associations with clinical outcome were observed for common mutations in APC.",

			"abstract": "The gradual accumulation of genetic mutations in human adult stem cells (ASCs) during life is associated with various age-related diseases, including cancer. Extreme variation in cancer risk across tissues was recently proposed to depend on the lifetime number of ASC divisions, owing to unavoidable random mutations that arise during DNA replication. However, the rates and patterns of mutations in normal ASCs remain unknown. Here we determine genome-wide mutation patterns in ASCs of the small intestine, colon and liver of human donors with ages ranging from 3 to 87 years by sequencing clonal organoid cultures derived from primary multipotent cells. Our results show that mutations accumulate steadily over time in all of the assessed tissue types, at a rate of approximately 40 novel mutations per year, despite the large variation in cancer incidence among these tissues. Liver ASCs, however, have different mutation spectra compared to those of the colon and small intestine. Mutational signature analysis reveals that this difference can be attributed to spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosine residues in the colon and small intestine, probably reflecting their high ASC division rate. In liver, a signature with an as-yet-unknown underlying mechanism is predominant. Mutation spectra of driver genes in cancer show high similarity to the tissue-specific ASC mutation spectra, suggesting that intrinsic mutational processes in ASCs can initiate tumorigenesis. Notably, the inter-individual variation in mutation rate and spectra are low, suggesting tissue-specific activity of common mutational processes throughout life.",

However, there has been no working model describing the specific functional consequences of the deranged genomic processes that result in the initiation and propagation of the cancer process during carcinogenesis. We no longer need to question whether or not cancer arises as a result of a molecular genetic defect within the cancer cell. The legitimate questions are: how and why? This article reviews the preeminent data on cancer molecular genetics and subsequently proposes that the sentinel event in cancer initiation is the aberrant production of fused transcription activators with new molecular properties within normal tissue stem cells. This results in the production of vital oncogenes with dysfunctional gene activation transcription properties, which leads to dysfunctional gene regulation, the aberrant activation of transduction pathways, chromosomal breakage, activation of driver oncogenes, reactivation of stem cell transduction pathways and the activation of genes that result in the hallmarks of cancer. Furthermore, a novel holistic molecular genetic model of cancer initiation and progression is presented along with a new paradigm for the approach to personalized targeted cancer therapy, clinical monitoring and cancer diagnosis.",

Some of these somatic mutations are drivers of the malignant process but the vast majority are passenger mutations. These passenger mutations can be deleterious to individual protein function but are tolerated by the cell or are offset by a survival advantage conferred by driver mutations. It is unknown if these somatic deleterious passenger mutations (DPMs) develop in the precancerous state of cirrhosis or if it is confined to HCC. Therefore, we studied four whole-exome sequencing datasets, including patients with non-cirrhotic liver (n = 12), cirrhosis without HCC (n = 6) and paired HCC with surrounding non-HCC liver (n = 74 paired samples), to identify DPMs. After filtering out putative germline mutations, we identified 187\u00b122 DPMs per non-diseased tissue. DPMs number was associated with liver disease progressing to HCC, independent of the number of exonic mutations. Tumours contained significantly more DPMs compared to paired non-tumour tissue (258-293 per HCC exome). Cirrhosis- and HCC-associated DPMs do not occur predominantly in specific genes, chromosomes or biological pathways and the effect on tumour biology is presently unknown. Importantly, for the first time we have shown a significant increase in DPMs with HCC.",

			"abstract": "Neoplastic transformation is driven by oncogenic lesions that facilitate unrestrained cell expansion and resistance to antiproliferative signals. These oncogenic DNA lesions, acquired through errors in DNA replication, gene recombination, or extrinsically imposed damage, are thought to activate multiple tumor suppressive pathways, particularly apoptotic cell death. DNA damage induces apoptosis through well-described p53-mediated induction of PUMA and NOXA. However, loss of both these mediators (even together with defects in p53-mediated induction of cell cycle arrest and cell senescence) does not recapitulate the tumor susceptibility observed in p53(-/-) mice. Thus, potentially oncogenic DNA lesions are likely to also trigger apoptosis through additional, p53-independent processes. We found that loss of the BH3-only protein BIM accelerated lymphoma development in p53-deficient mice. This process was negated by concomitant loss of RAG1/2-mediated antigen receptor gene rearrangement. This demonstrates that BIM is critical for the induction of apoptosis caused by potentially oncogenic DNA lesions elicited by RAG1/2-induced gene rearrangement. Furthermore, this highlights the role of a BIM-mediated tumor suppressor pathway that acts in parallel to the p53 pathway and remains active even in the absence of wild-type p53 function, suggesting this may be exploited in the treatment of p53-deficient cancers.",

			"abstract": "A complex disease generally results not from malfunction of individual molecules but from dysfunction of the relevant system or network, which dynamically changes with time and conditions. Thus, estimating a condition-specific network from a single sample is crucial to elucidating the molecular mechanisms of complex diseases at the system level. However, there is currently no effective way to construct such an individual-specific network by expression profiling of a single sample because of the requirement of multiple samples for computing correlations. We developed here with a statistical method, i.e. a sample-specific network (SSN) method, which allows us to construct individual-specific networks based on molecular expressions of a single sample. Using this method, we can characterize various human diseases at a network level. In particular, such SSNs can lead to the identification of individual-specific disease modules as well as driver genes, even without gene sequencing information. Extensive analysis by using the Cancer Genome Atlas data not only demonstrated the effectiveness of the method, but also found new individual-specific driver genes and network patterns for various types of cancer. Biological experiments on drug resistance further validated one important advantage of our method over the traditional methods, i.e. we can even identify such drug resistance genes that actually have no clear differential expression between samples with and without the resistance, due to the additional network information.",

			"abstract": "Many studies have demonstrated that some genes (e.g. APC, BRAF, KRAS, PTEN, TP53) are frequently mutated in cancer, however, underlying mechanism that contributes to their high mutation frequency remains unclear. Here we used Apriori algorithm to find the frequent mutational gene sets (FMGSs) from 4,904 tumors across 11 cancer types as part of the TCGA Pan-Cancer effort and then mined the hidden association rules (ARs) within these FMGSs. Intriguingly, we found that well-known cancer driver genes such as BRAF, KRAS, PTEN, and TP53 were often co-occurred with other driver genes and FMGSs size peaked at an itemset size of 3~4 genes. Besides, the number and constitution of FMGS and ARs differed greatly among different cancers and stages. In addition, FMGS and ARs were rare in endocrine-related cancers such as breast carcinoma, ovarian cystadenocarcinoma, and thyroid carcinoma, but abundant in cancers contact directly with external environments such as skin melanoma and stomach adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, we observed more rules in stage IV than in other stages, indicating that distant metastasis needed more sophisticated gene regulatory network.",

Although specific germline mutations have been recognized as cancer inducers, the vast majority of neoplastic changes in humans occur through environmental exposure, lifestyle, and diet. An emerging concept in cancer biology implicates the microbiota as a powerful environmental factor modulating the carcinogenic process. For example, the intestinal microbiota influences cancer development or therapeutic responses through specific activities (immune responses, metabolites, microbial structures, and toxins). The numerous effects of microbiota on carcinogenesis, ranging from promoting, preventing, or even influencing therapeutic outcomes, highlight the complex relationship between the biota and the host. In this review, we discuss the latest findings on this complex microbial interaction with the host and highlight potential mechanisms by which the microbiota mediates such a wide impact on carcinogenesis.",

To determine the role of gene overexpression on chromosome instability (CIN), we performed genome-wide screens in the budding yeast for yeast genes that cause CIN when overexpressed, a phenotype we refer to as dosage CIN (dCIN), and identified 245 dCIN genes. This catalog of genes reveals human orthologs known to be recurrently overexpressed and/or amplified in tumors. We show that two genes, TDP1, a tyrosyl-DNA-phosphdiesterase, and TAF12, an RNA polymerase II TATA-box binding factor, cause CIN when overexpressed in human cells. Rhabdomyosarcoma lines with elevated human Tdp1 levels also exhibit CIN that can be partially rescued by siRNA-mediated knockdown of TDP1 Overexpression of dCIN genes represents a genetic vulnerability that could be leveraged for selective killing of cancer cells through targeting of an unlinked synthetic dosage lethal (SDL) partner. Using SDL screens in yeast, we identified a set of genes that when deleted specifically kill cells with high levels of Tdp1. One gene was the histone deacetylase RPD3, for which there are known inhibitors. Both HT1080 cells overexpressing hTDP1 and rhabdomyosarcoma cells with elevated levels of hTdp1 were more sensitive to histone deacetylase inhibitors valproic acid (VPA) and trichostatin A (TSA), recapitulating the SDL interaction in human cells and suggesting VPA and TSA as potential therapeutic agents for tumors with elevated levels of hTdp1. The catalog of dCIN genes presented here provides a candidate list to identify genes that cause CIN when overexpressed in cancer, which can then be leveraged through SDL to selectively target tumors.",

			"abstract": "Prion diseases are disorders that share several characteristics that are typical of many neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, several studies have extended the prion concept to pathological aggregation in malignant tumors involving misfolded p53, a tumor-suppressor protein. The aggregation of p53 and its coaggregation with p53 family members, p63 and p73, have been shown. Certain p53 mutants exert a dominant-negative regulatory effect on wild-type (WT) p53. The basis for this dominant-negative effect is that amyloid-like mutant p53 converts WT p53 into an aggregated species, leading to a gain-of-function (GoF) phenotype and the loss of its tumor-suppressor function. Recently, it was shown that p53 aggregates can be internalized by cells and can coaggregate with endogenous p53, corroborating the prion-like properties of p53 aggregates. The prion-like behavior of oncogenic p53 mutants provides an explanation for its dominant-negative and GoF properties, including the high metastatic potential of cancer cells carrying p53 mutations. The inhibition of p53 aggregation appears to represent a promising target for therapeutic intervention in patients with malignant tumors.",

We further show major differences between the mutational patterns of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes in normal tissues. Lastly, the mutation spectra of normal tissues were different from each other, but similar to those of the cancers that arose in them.

Here we report on a novel human RAD51 variant found in an aggressive and therapy-refractive breast carcinoma. Expression of the RAD51 G151D variant in human breast epithelial cells increases the levels of homology-directed repair. Expression of RAD51 G151D in cells also promotes high levels of chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges. In vitro, the purified RAD51 G151D protein directly and significantly enhances DNA strand exchange activity in the presence of RPA. In concordance with this result, co-incubation of G151D with BRCA2 resulted in a much higher level of strand-exchange activity compared to WT RAD51. Strikingly, the RAD51 G151D variant confers resistance to multiple DNA damaging agents, including ionizing radiation, mitomycin C, and doxorubicin. Our findings demonstrate that the RAD51 G151D somatic variant has a novel hyper-recombination phenotype and suggest that this property of the protein is important for the repair of DNA damage, leading to drug resistance.",

Here, we examined the cellular/molecular mechanisms underlying this association, aiming to identify new molecular tools to improve diagnosis, prognosis or therapy. A gene expression array comparing sst5TMD4 stably-transfected MCF-7 cells and their controls (empty-plasmid) revealed the existence of profound alterations in the expression of genes involved in key tumoral processes, such as cell survival or angiogenesis. Moreover, sst5TMD4-overexpressing MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells demonstrated increased expression/production of pro-angiogenic factors and enhanced capacity to form mammospheres. Consistently, sst5TMD4-expressing MCF-7 cells induced xenografted tumors with higher VEGF levels and elevated number of blood vessels. Importantly, sst5TMD4 was expressed in a subset of breast cancers, where it correlated with angiogenic markers, lymphatic metastasis, and reduced disease-free survival. These results, coupled to our previous data, support a relevant role of sst5TMD4 in the angiogenic process and reinforce the role of sst5TMD4 in breast cancer malignancy and metastatic potential, supporting its possible utility to develop new molecular biomarkers and drug therapies for these tumors.",

To catalog the rules governing how somatic mutation exerts direct transcriptional effects, we developed an exhaustive pipeline for analyzing RNA sequencing data, which we integrated with whole genomes from 23 breast cancers. Using X-inactivation analyses, we found that cancer cells are more transcriptionally active than intermixed stromal cells. This is especially true in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors. Overall, 59% of substitutions were expressed. Nonsense mutations showed lower expression levels than expected, with patterns characteristic of nonsense-mediated decay. 14% of 4,234 rearrangements caused transcriptional abnormalities, including exon skips, exon reusage, fusions, and premature polyadenylation. We found productive, stable transcription from sense-to-antisense gene fusions and gene-to-intergenic rearrangements, suggesting that these mutation classes drive more transcriptional disruption than previously suspected. Systematic integration of transcriptome with genome data reveals the rules by which transcriptional machinery interprets somatic mutation.",

Here, we comprehensively characterize the mutational profiles of diverse transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) across 1,574 completely sequenced cancer genomes encompassing 11 tumour types. We assess the relative rates and impact of the mutational burden at the binding sites of 81 transcription factors (TFs), by comparing the abundance and patterns of single base substitutions within putatively functional binding sites to control sites with matched sequence composition. There is a strong (1.43-fold) and significant excess of mutations at functional binding sites across TFs, and the mutations that accumulate in cancers are typically more disruptive than variants tolerated in extant human populations at the same sites. CTCF binding sites suffer an exceptionally high mutational load in cancer (3.31-fold excess) relative to control sites, and we demonstrate for the first time that this effect is seen in essentially all cancer types with sufficient data. The sub-set of CTCF sites involved in higher order chromatin structures has the highest mutational burden, suggesting a widespread breakdown of chromatin organization. However, we find no evidence for selection driving these distinctive patterns of mutation. The mutational load at CTCF-binding sites is substantially determined by replication timing and the mutational signature of the tumor in question, suggesting that selectively neutral processes underlie the unusual mutation patterns. Pervasive hyper-mutation within transcription factor binding sites rewires the regulatory landscape of the cancer genome, but it is dominated by mutational processes rather than selection.",

There is well-documented evidence that reactivation of telomerase occurs during cellular transformation.

In this review, we will focus on the telomerase positive tumors. In this context, the recent findings that telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutations represent the most common non-coding mutations in human cancer have flared up the long-standing discussion whether cancer originates from telomerase positive stem cells or telomerase reactivation is a final step in cellular transformation. Here, we will discuss the pros and cons of both concepts in the context of telomere length-dependent and telomere length-independent functions of telomerase. Together, these observations may provoke a re-evaluation of telomere and telomerase based therapies, both in telomerase inhibition for cancer therapy and telomerase activation for tissue regeneration and anti-ageing strategies.",

			"abstract": "Decades of years might be required for an initiated cell to become a fully-pledged, metastasized tumor. DNA mutations are accumulated during this process including background mutations that emerge scholastically, as well as driver mutations that selectively occur in a handful of cancer genes and confer the cell a growth advantage over its neighbors. A clone of tumor cells could be superseded by another clone that acquires new mutations and grows more aggressively. Tumor evolutional patterns have been studied for years using conventional approaches that focus on the investigation of a single or a couple of genes. Latest deep sequencing technology enables a global view of tumor evolution by deciphering almost all genome aberrations in a tumor. Tumor clones and the fate of each clone during tumor evolution can be depicted with the help of the concept of variant allele frequency. Here, we summarize the new insights of cancer evolutional progression in acute myeloid leukemia. Cancer evolution is currently thought to start from a clone that has accumulated the requisite somatically-acquired genetic aberrations through a series of increasingly disordered clinical and pathological phases, eventually leading to malignant transformation [1-3]. The observations in invasive colorectal cancer that usually emerges from an antecedent benign adenomatous polyp and in cervical cancer that proceeds through intraepithelial neoplasia support the idea of stepwise or linear cancerous progression [3-5]. Genetically, such progression is achieved by successive waves of clonal expansion during which cells acquire novel genomic alterations including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions and deletions (indels), and/or copy number variations (CNVs) [6]. The latest improvement in sequencing technology has allowed the deciphering of the whole exome or genome in different types of tumor and normal tissue pairs, providing detailed catalogue about genome aberrations during tumor initiation and progression, which have been reviewed in several papers [7-10]. Here, we focus on demonstrating the cancer clonal evolution pattern revealed by recent deep sequencing studies of samples from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients.",

			"abstract": "Genomic instability drives cancer progression by promoting genetic abnormalities that allow for the multi-step clonal selection of cells with growth advantages. We previously reported that the IL-9-dependent TS1 cell line sequentially acquired activating substitutions in JAK1 and JAK3 upon successive selections for growth factor independent and JAK inhibitor-resistant cells, suggestive of a defect in mutation avoidance mechanisms. In the first part of this paper, we discovered that the gene encoding mutL homolog-1 (MLH1), a key component of the DNA mismatch repair system, is silenced by promoter methylation in TS1 cells. By means of stable ectopic expression and RNA interference methods, we showed that the high frequencies of growth factor-independent and inhibitor-resistant cells with activating JAK mutations can be attributed to the absence of MLH1 expression. In the second part of this paper, we confirm the clinical relevance of our findings by showing that chronic myeloid leukemia relapses upon ABL-targeted therapy correlated with a lower expression of MLH1 messenger RNA. Interestingly, the mutational profile observed in our TS1 model, characterized by a strong predominance of T:A>C:G transitions, was identical to the one described in the literature for primitive cells derived from chronic myeloid leukemia patients. Taken together, our observations demonstrate for the first time a causal relationship between MLH1-deficiency and incidence of oncogenic point mutations in tyrosine kinases driving cell transformation and acquired resistance to kinase-targeted cancer therapies.",

To examine this potential, here we evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art sequence analysis methods to specifically recover known cancer genes. While some cancer genes are identified by analysis of recurrence, spatial clustering or predicted impact of somatic mutations, many remain undetected due to lack of power to discriminate driver mutations from the background mutational load (13-60% recall of cancer genes impacted by somatic single-nucleotide variants, depending on the method). Cancer genes not detected by mutation recurrence also tend to be missed by all types of exome analysis. Nonetheless, these genes are implicated by other experiments such as functional genetic screens and expression profiling. These challenges are only partially addressed by increasing sample size and will likely hold even as greater numbers of tumours are analysed.",

We present the T: ata M: emorial C: entre-SNP D: ata B: ase (TMC-SNPdb), as the first open source, flexible, upgradable, and freely available SNP database (accessible through dbSNP build 149 and ANNOVAR)-representing 114 309 unique germline variants-generated from whole exome data of 62 normal samples derived from cancer patients of Indian origin.

Using an institutional generated whole exome data set of 132 samples of Indian origin, we demonstrate that TMC-SNPdb could deplete 42, 33 and 28% false positive somatic events post dbSNP depletion in Indian origin tongue, gallbladder, and cervical cancer samples, respectively.

Coffee consumption, however, has also been linked to an increased risk of developing some types of cancer, including bladder cancer in adults and leukemia in children of mothers who drink coffee during pregnancy. Since cancer is driven by the accumulation of DNA alterations, the ability of the coffee constituent caffeic acid to induce DNA damage in cells may play a role in the carcinogenic potential of this beverage. This carcinogenic potential may be exacerbated in cells with DNA repair defects. People with the genetic disease Fanconi Anemia have DNA repair deficiencies and are predisposed to several cancers, particularly acute myeloid leukemia. Defects in the DNA repair protein Fanconi Anemia D2 (FANCD2) also play an important role in the development of a variety of cancers (e.g., bladder cancer) in people without this genetic disease. This communication shows that cells deficient in FANCD2 are hypersensitive to the cytotoxicity (clonogenic assay) and DNA damage (\u03b3-H2AX and 53BP1 focus assay) induced by caffeic acid and by a commercial lyophilized coffee extract. These data suggest that people with Fanconi Anemia, or healthy people who develop sporadic mutations in FANCD2, may be hypersensitive to the carcinogenic activity of coffee.",

We find that cell lines faithfully recapitulate oncogenic alterations identified in tumors, find that many of these associate with drug sensitivity/resistance, and highlight the importance of tissue lineage in mediating drug response. Logic-based modeling uncovers combinations of alterations that sensitize to drugs, while machine learning demonstrates the relative importance of different data types in predicting drug response.

Advances in high-throughput technologies, like gene expression profiling, next-generation sequencing, proteomics, and metabolomics, have enabled detailed molecular characterization of various tumors. The integration and analyses of these high-throughput data have unraveled many novel molecular aberrations and network alterations in tumors. These molecular alterations include multiple cancer-driving mutations, gene fusions, amplification, deletion, and post-translational modifications, among others. Many of these genomic events are being used in cancer diagnosis, whereas others are therapeutically targeted with small-molecule inhibitors. Multiple genes/enzymes that play a role in DNA and histone modifications are also altered in various cancers, changing the epigenomic landscape during cancer initiation and progression. Apart from protein-coding genes, studies are uncovering the critical regulatory roles played by noncoding RNAs and noncoding regions of the genome during cancer progression. Many of these genomic and epigenetic events function in tandem to drive tumor development and metastasis. Concurrent advances in genome-modulating technologies, like gene silencing and genome editing, are providing ability to understand in detail\u00a0the process of cancer initiation, progression, and signaling as well as opening up avenues for\u00a0therapeutic targeting.

Using quantitative proteomics, chemoproteomics and biochemical fractionation, we found that native BRD4 and DOT1L exist in separate protein complexes. Genetic disruption or small-molecule inhibition of BRD4 and DOT1L showed marked synergistic activity against MLL leukemia cell lines, primary human leukemia cells and mouse leukemia models. Mechanistically, we found a previously unrecognized functional collaboration between DOT1L and BRD4 that is especially important at highly transcribed genes in proximity to superenhancers. DOT1L, via dimethylated histone H3 K79, facilitates histone H4 acetylation, which in turn regulates the binding of BRD4 to chromatin.

			"abstract": "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has demonstrated that the cancer genomes are peppered with mutations. Although most somatic tumour mutations are unlikely to have any role in the cancer process per se, the spectra of DNA sequence changes in tumour mutation catalogues have the potential to identify the mutagens, and to reveal the mutagenic processes responsible for human cancer. Very recently, a novel approach for data mining of the vast compilations of tumour NGS data succeeded in separating and precisely defining at least 30 distinct patterns of sequence change hidden in mutation databases. At least half of these mutational signatures can be readily assigned to known human carcinogenic exposures or endogenous mechanisms of mutagenesis. A quantum leap in our knowledge of mutagenesis in human cancers has resulted, stimulating a flurry of research activity. We trace here the major findings leading first to the hypothesis that carcinogenic insults leave characteristic imprints on the DNA sequence of tumours, and culminating in empirical evidence from NGS data that well-defined carcinogen mutational signatures are indeed present in tumour genomic DNA from a variety of cancer types. The notion that tumour DNAs can divulge environmental sources of mutation is now a well-accepted fact. This approach to cancer aetiology has also incriminated various endogenous, enzyme-driven processes that increase the somatic mutation load in sporadic cancers. The tasks now confronting the field of molecular epidemiology are to assign mutagenic processes to orphan and newly discovered tumour mutation patterns, and to determine whether avoidable cancer risk factors influence signatures produced by endogenous enzymatic mechanisms. Innovative research with experimental models and exploitation of the geographical heterogeneity in cancer incidence can address these challenges.",

Both are characterized by impairments in cognitive functions, emotions and behaviour, and they undermine basic human processes of perception and judgment. Despite decades of extensive research, the aetiologies of schizophrenia and ASD are still poorly understood and remain a significant challenge to clinicians and scientists alike. Adding to this unsatisfactory situation, patients with schizophrenia or ASD often develop a variety of peripheral and systemic disturbances, one prominent example of which is cancer, which shows a direct (but sometimes inverse) comorbidity in people affected with schizophrenia and ASD. Cancer is a disease characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of cells, the molecular origin of which derives from mutations of a cell's DNA sequence. To counteract such mutations and repair damaged DNA, cells are equipped with intricate DNA repair pathways. Oxidative stress, oxidative DNA damage, and deficient repair of oxidative DNA lesions repair have been proposed to contribute to the development of schizophrenia and ASD. In this article, we summarize the current evidence of cancer comorbidity in these brain disorders and discuss the putative roles of oxidative stress, DNA damage and DNA repair in the aetiopathology of schizophrenia and ASD.",

Moving to an integrated system is potentially very relevant. To implement such an integrated system: we focus on an important region of the signaling network, immediately above the G1-S restriction point, and discuss the reconstruction of a Molecular Interaction Map and interrogating it with a dynamic mathematical model. Extensive model pretraining achieved satisfactory, validated, performance. The model helps to propose future target combination priorities, and restricts drastically the number of drugs to be finally tested at a cellular, in vivo, and clinical-trial level. Our model allows for the inclusion of the unique molecular profiles of each individual patient's tumor.

Genomic and transcriptomic profiling of lung cancer not only further our knowledge about cancer initiation and progression, but could also provide guidance on treatment decisions. The fact that targeted treatment is most successful in a subset of tumors indicates the need for better classification of clinically related molecular tumor phenotypes based on better understanding of the mutations in relevant genes, especially in those oncogenic driver mutations. EGFR gene mutations, KRAS gene mutations, EML4-ALK rearrangements and altered MET signaling are widely recognized alterations that play important roles in both the biological mechanisms and the clinical sensitivity to treatment in lung cancer. In this article, we reviewed the discovery of the clinical values of these oncogenic driver mutations and the clinical studies revealing the prognostic and predictive values of these biomarkers for clinical sensitivity and resistance to anti-EGFR therapy or other targeted therapies. These form the basis of personalized treatment in lung cancer based on biomarker profiles of individual tumor, leading to therapeutic advancement and betterment.",

			"abstract": "The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy, as a measure of randomness in a system, increases over time. Although studies have investigated biological sequence randomness from different aspects, it remains unknown whether sequence randomness changes over time and whether this change consists with the second law of thermodynamics. To capture the dynamics of randomness in molecular sequence evolution, here we detect sequence randomness based on a collection of eight statistical random tests and investigate the randomness variation of coding sequences with an application to Escherichia coli. Given that core/essential genes are more ancient than specific/non-essential genes, our results clearly show that core/essential genes are more random than specific/non-essential genes and accordingly indicate that sequence randomness indeed increases over time, consistent well with the second law of thermodynamics. We further find that an increase in sequence randomness leads to increasing randomness of GC content and longer sequence length. Taken together, our study presents an important finding, for the first time, that sequence randomness increases over time, which may provide profound insights for unveiling the underlying mechanisms of molecular sequence evolution.",

Here, we focus on proteins that translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to external signals and regulate transcription without binding to DNA directly (for example, through interaction with transcription factors). We propose that proteins with such characteristics are classified as a distinct group of extracellular signalling effectors, and we suggest the term STRaND (shuttling transcriptional regulators and non-DNA binding) to refer to this group. Crucial roles of STRaNDs include linking cell morphology and adhesion with changes in transcriptional programmes in response to signals such as mechanical stresses.",

Despite the clonal origin of the CTVT nuclear genome, CTVT mitochondrial genomes (mtDNAs) have been acquired by periodic capture from transient hosts. We sequenced 449 complete mtDNAs from a global population of CTVTs, and show that mtDNA horizontal transfer has occurred at least five times, delineating five tumour clades whose distributions track two millennia of dog global migration. Negative selection has operated to prevent accumulation of deleterious mutations in captured mtDNA, and recombination has caused occasional mtDNA re-assortment. These findings implicate functional mtDNA as a driver of CTVT global metastatic spread, further highlighting the important role of mtDNA in cancer evolution.",

However, most point mutations occur at low frequency, and the function of these alleles remains undefined. We have developed a scalable systematic approach to interrogate the function of cancer-associated gene variants. We subjected 474 mutant alleles curated from 5,338 tumors to pooled in vivo tumor formation assays and gene expression profiling. We identified 12 transforming alleles, including two in genes (PIK3CB, POT1) that have not been shown to be tumorigenic. One rare KRAS allele, D33E, displayed tumorigenicity and constitutive activation of known RAS effector pathways. By comparing gene expression changes induced upon expression of wild-type and mutant alleles, we inferred the activity of specific alleles. Because alleles found to be mutated only once in 5,338 tumors rendered cells tumorigenic, these observations underscore the value of integrating genomic information with functional studies.",

The trial is especially topical because it comes at a time when there are calls for a Pre-Cancer Genome Atlas (PCGA) for \"understanding the earliest molecular and cellular events associated with cancer initiation\u2026\" This commentary discusses current concepts in prevention research including branched evolution that leads to therapeutic resistance. Length bias sampling postulates underdiagnosis is due to rapidly progressing disease that is difficult to detect by screening because it progresses to cancer too rapidly and that overdiagnosis is the result of very slowly or nonprogressing disease that is easy to detect by screening because it persists for a lifetime and the patient dies of unrelated causes. Finally, it also explores study designs, including surrogate endpoints in Barrett esophagus trials, and opportunities and pitfalls for a PCGA in the context of high levels of over and underdiagnosis of Barrett esophagus as well as many other cancers and their precursors.

We found that 93 protein-coding cancer genes carried probable driver mutations. Some non-coding regions exhibited high mutation frequencies, but most have distinctive structural features probably causing elevated mutation rates and do not contain driver mutations. Mutational signature analysis was extended to genome rearrangements and revealed twelve base substitution and six rearrangement signatures. Three rearrangement signatures, characterized by tandem duplications or deletions, appear associated with defective homologous-recombination-based DNA repair: one with deficient BRCA1 function, another with deficient BRCA1 or BRCA2 function, the cause of the third is unknown. This analysis of all classes of somatic mutation across exons, introns and intergenic regions highlights the repertoire of cancer genes and mutational processes operating, and progresses towards a comprehensive account of the somatic genetic basis of breast cancer.",

Here, we present a web tool, named Integrated Clustering of Multi-dimensional biomedical data (ICM), that provides an interface from which to fuse, cluster and visualize multi-dimensional biomedical data and knowledge. With ICM, users can explore the heterogeneity of a disease or a biological process by identifying subgroups of patients. The results obtained can then be interactively modified by using an intuitive user interface. Researchers can also exchange the results from ICM with collaborators via a web link containing a Project ID number that will directly pull up the analysis results being shared. ICM also support incremental clustering that allows users to add new sample data into the data of a previous study to obtain a clustering result. Currently, the ICM web server is available with no login requirement and at no cost at http://biotech.bmi.ac.cn/icm/.",

By performing systematic analysis of the TNF-\u03b1 signaling network model, we identify the critical dose which separates the cell survival and apoptosis regions and define the sensitive parameters with single-parameter sensitivity analysis. Combining with the cancer-related mutation spectra obtained from 9 cancers, our results hint that, similar as missense and nonsense mutations, synonymous mutations are also strongly correlated with the parameter sensitivity of the critical dose, providing possible causal mechanism of the mutations in cancer development. Based on such a correlation, we furthermore dissect that members of caspases family proteases (caspase3, 6, 8) could jointly inhibit NF\u03baB activation, providing efficient pro-apoptotic behavior. Thus, we argue that apoptosis module could suppress survival module through negative feedback of caspases family on NF\u03baB.",

			"abstract": "Mutational processes and signatures that drive early tumorigenesis are centrally important for early cancer prevention. Yet, to date, biomarkers and risk factors for polyps (adenomas) that inordinately and rapidly develop into colon cancer remain poorly defined. Here, we describe surprisingly high mutational profiles through whole-genome sequence (WGS) analysis in 2 of 4 pairs of benign colorectal adenoma tissue samples. Unsupervised hierarchical clustered transcriptomic analysis of a further 7 pairs of adenomas reveals distinct mutational signatures regardless of adenoma size. Transitional single nucleotide substitutions of C:G>T:A predominate in the adenoma mutational spectrum. Strikingly, we observe mutations in the TGF-\u03b2 pathway and CEA-associated genes in 4 out of 11 adenomas, overlapping with the Wnt pathway. Immunohistochemical labeling reveals a nearly 5-fold increase in CEA levels in 23% of adenoma samples with a concomitant loss of TGF-\u03b2 signaling. We also define a functional role by which the CEA B3 domain interacts with TGFBR1, potentially inactivating the tumor suppressor function of TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Our study uncovers diverse mutational processes underlying the transition from early adenoma to cancer. This has broad implications for biomarker-driven targeting of CEA/TGF-\u03b2 in high-risk adenomas and may lead to early detection of aggressive adenoma to CRC progression.",

Since then, a multitude of studies on this topic has been published, covering a wide range of divergent results and arguments. The reported prevalence of this alteration in breast cancer ranges from 0% to 75%, suggesting that ESR1 copy number analysis is hampered by technical and interpreter issues. To date, two major issues related to ESR1 amplification remain to be conclusively addressed: (1) The extent to which abundant amounts of messenger RNA can mimic amplification in standard fluorescence in situ hybridization assays in the analysis of strongly expressed genes like ESR1, and (2) the clinical relevance of ESR1 amplification: Such relevance is strongly disputed, with data showing predictive value for response as well as for resistance of the cancer to anti-estrogen therapies, or for subsequent development of cancers in the case of precursor lesions that display amplification of ESR1. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the various views on ESR1 amplification, and highlights explanations for the contradictions and conflicting data that could inform future ESR1 research.",

			"abstract": "Cancer is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Cancer arises due to a series of somatic mutations that accumulate within the nucleus of a cell which enable the cell to proliferate in an unregulated manner. These mutations arise as a result of both endogenous and exogenous factors. Genes that are commonly mutated in cancer cells are involved in cell cycle regulation, growth and proliferation. It is known that both nature and nurture play important roles in cancer development through complex gene-environment interactions; however, the exact mechanism of these interactions in carcinogenesis is presently unclear. Key environmental factors that play a role in carcinogenesis include smoking, UV light and oncoviruses. Angiogenesis, inflammation and altered cell metabolism are important factors in carcinogenesis and are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Although the exact mechanism of nature-nurture interactions in solid tumour formation are not yet fully understood, it is evident that neither nature nor nurture can be considered in isolation. By understanding more about gene-environment interactions, it is possible that cancer mortality could be reduced.",

			"abstract": "Advances in deep genomic sequencing have identified a spectrum of cancer-specific passenger and driver aberrations. Clones with driver anomalies are believed to be positively selected during carcinogenesis. Accumulating evidence, however, shows that genomic alterations, such as those inBRAF,RAS,EGFR,HER2,FGFR3,PIK3CA,TP53,CDKN2A, andNF1/2, all of which are considered hallmark drivers of specific cancers, can also be identified in benign and premalignant conditions, occasionally at frequencies higher than in their malignant counterparts. Targeting these genomic drivers can produce dramatic responses in advanced cancer, but the effects on their benign counterparts are less clear. This benign-malignant phenomenon is well illustrated in studies ofBRAFV600E mutations, which are paradoxically more frequent in benign nevi (\u223c80%) than in dysplastic nevi (\u223c60%) or melanoma (\u223c40%-45%). Similarly, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 is more commonly overexpressed in ductal carcinoma in situ (\u223c27%-56%) when compared with invasive breast cancer (\u223c11%-20%).FGFR3mutations in bladder cancer also decrease with tumor grade (low-grade tumors, \u223c61%; high-grade, \u223c11%). \"Driver\" mutations also occur in nonmalignant settings:TP53mutations in synovial tissue from rheumatoid arthritis andFGFR3mutations in seborrheic keratosis. The latter observations suggest that the oncogenicity of these alterations may be tissue context-dependent. The conversion of benign conditions to premalignant disease may involve other genetic events and/or epigenetic reprogramming. Putative driver mutations can also be germline and associated with increased cancer risk (eg, germlineRASorTP53alterations), but germlineFGFR3orNF2abnormalities do not predispose to malignancy. We discuss the enigma of genetic \"drivers\" in benign and premalignant conditions and the implications for prevention strategies and theories of tumorigenesis.",

			"abstract": "The accuracy of replicating the genetic code is fundamental. DNA repair mechanisms protect the fidelity of the genome ensuring a low error rate between generations. This sustains the similarity of individuals whilst providing a repertoire of variants for evolution. The mutation rate in the human genome has recently been measured to be 50-70 de novo single nucleotide variants (SNVs) between generations. During development mutations accumulate in somatic cells so that an organism is a mosaic. However, variation within a tissue and between tissues has not been analysed. By reprogramming somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), their genomes and the associated mutational history are captured. By sequencing the genomes of polyclonal and monoclonal somatic cells and derived iPSCs we have determined the mutation rates and show how the patterns change from a somatic lineage in vivo through to iPSCs. Somatic cells have a mutation rate of 14 SNVs per cell per generation while iPSCs exhibited a ten-fold lower rate. Analyses of mutational signatures suggested that deamination of methylated cytosine may be the major mutagenic source in vivo, whilst oxidative DNA damage becomes dominant in vitro. Our results provide insights for better understanding of mutational processes and lineage relationships between human somatic cells. Furthermore it provides a foundation for interpretation of elevated mutation rates and patterns in cancer.",

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between chronic inflammation and DNA damage, as well as the possible role of DNA damage in esophageal carcinogenic process. Endoscopic esophageal biopsies from 109 individuals from Chaoshan littoral, a high-risk region for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), were examined to evaluate the association between chronic inflammation and histological severity, while additional 204 esophageal non-tumor samples from patients with ESCC were collected. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the oxidative DNA damage and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Significantly positive correlation was observed between degree of chronic inflammation and esophageal precursor lesions (rs = 0.37, P < 0.01). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that oxidative DNA damage level was positively correlated with the degree of chronic inflammation (rs = 0.21, P < 0.05). Moreover, the level of oxidative DNA damage positively correlated with histological severity (rs = 0.49, P < 0.01). We found that the extent of DSBs was progressively increased with inflammation degree (P < 0.01) and the progression of precancerous lesions (P < 0.001). Collectively, these findings provide evidence linking chronic inflammation-associated genomic instability with esophageal carcinogenesis and suggest possibilities for early detection and intervention of esophageal carcinogenesis.",

			"abstract": "Cancer is a disease of the genome caused by oncogene activation and tumor suppressor gene inhibition. Deep sequencing studies including large consortia such as TCGA and ICGC identified numerous tumor-specific mutations not only in protein-coding sequences but also in non-coding sequences. Although 98% of the genome is not translated into proteins, most studies have neglected the information hidden in this \"dark matter\" of the genome. Malignancy-driving mutations can occur in all genetic elements outside the coding region, namely in enhancer, silencer, insulator, and promoter as well as in 5'-UTR and 3'-UTR Intron or splice site mutations can alter the splicing pattern. Moreover, cancer genomes contain mutations within non-coding RNA, such as microRNA, lncRNA, and lincRNA A synonymous mutation changes the coding region in the DNA and RNA but not the protein sequence. Importantly, oncogenes such as TERT or miR-21 as well as tumor suppressor genes such as TP53/p53, APC, BRCA1, or RB1 can be affected by these alterations. In summary, coding-independent mutations can affect gene regulation from transcription, splicing, mRNA stability to translation, and hence, this largely neglected area needs functional studies to elucidate the mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis. This review will focus on the important role and novel mechanisms of these non-coding or allegedly silent mutations in tumorigenesis.",

We also examined the codon changes for the widely mutated TP53 and PIK3CA in tumor stages. Combinations of one to three driver genes specifically dominated in each cancer. Across the clinical stages, we categorized three patterns for the behaviors of driver genes' mutation changes in the nine cancer types: recurrently mutated in all the stages and triggering other mutations; certain mutations lost meanwhile other mutations emerged; mutations dominated across entire stages, while other mutations gradually appeared or disappeared. We observed different codon changes dominated in different stages and revealed mutations recurrently occurring on the hotspot regions of the coding sequence may be the core factor for driver genes' tumorigenesis. Our results highlighted the dynamic changes of oncogenesis roles in different clinical stages and suggested different diagnostic decision making according to the clinical stages of patients.",

We now know that the genetic events that drive aberrant cancer cell proliferation also alter biochemical metabolism, including promoting aerobic glycolysis, but do not typically impair mitochondrial function. Mitochondria supply energy; provide building blocks for new cells; and control redox homeostasis, oncogenic signaling, innate immunity, and apoptosis. Indeed, mitochondrial biogenesis and quality control are often upregulated in cancers. While some cancers have mutations in nuclear-encoded mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes that produce oncogenic metabolites, there is negative selection for pathogenic mitochondrial genome mutations. Eliminating mtDNA limits tumorigenesis, and rare human tumors with mutant mitochondrial genomes are relatively benign. Thus, mitochondria play a central and multifunctional role in malignant tumor progression, and targeting mitochondria provides therapeutic opportunities.",

Mice engineered with these mutations provide a foundation for understanding leukemogenesis and identifying therapies. However, data from whole genome studies provide evidence that malignancies are characterized by multiple genetic alterations that vary between patients, as well as inherited genetic variation that can also contribute to oncogenesis. Improved outcomes will require precision medicine approaches-targeted therapies tailored to malignancies in each patient. Preclinical models that reflect the range of mutations and the genetic background present in patient populations are required to develop and test the combinations of therapies that will be used to provide precision medicine therapeutic strategies. Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) produced by transplanting leukemia cells from patients into immune deficient mice provide preclinical models where disease mechanisms and therapeutic efficacy can be studied in vivo in context of the genetic variability present in patient tumors. PDX models are possible because many elements in the bone marrow microenvironment show cross-species activity between mice and humans. However, several cytokines likely to impact leukemia cells are species-specific with limited activity on transplanted human leukemia cells. In this review we discuss the importance of PDX models for developing precision medicine approaches to leukemia treatment. We illustrate how PDX models can be optimized to overcome a lack of cross-species cytokine activity by reviewing a recent strategy developed for use with a high-risk form of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) that is characterized by overexpression of CRLF2, a receptor component for the cytokine, TSLP.",

This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from \"Diverse somatic mutation patterns and pathway alterations in human cancers\" by Kan and colleagues published in Nature in 2010 (Kan et al., 2010). The experiments to be replicated are those reported in Figures 3D-F and 4C-F. Kan and colleagues utilized mismatch repair detection (MRD) technology to identify somatic mutations in primary human tumor samples and identified a previously uncharacterized arginine 243 to histidine (R243H) mutation in the G-protein \u03b1 subunit GNAO1 in breast carcinoma tissue. In Figures 3D-F, Kan and colleagues demonstrated that stable expression of mutant GNAO1(R243D) conferred a significant growth advantage in human mammary epithelial cells, confirming the oncogenic potential of this mutation. Similarly, expression of variants with somatic mutations in MAP2K4, a JNK pathway kinase (shown in Figures 4C-E) resulted in a significant increase in anchorage-independent growth. Interestingly, these mutants exhibited reduced kinase activity compared to wild type MAP2K4, indicating these mutations impose a dominant-negative influence to promote growth (Figure 4F). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the Center for Open Science and Science Exchange and the results of the replications will be published in eLife.",

			"abstract": "Chromothripsis is the massive but highly localized chromosomal rearrangement in response to a one-step catastrophic event, rather than an accumulation of a series of subsequent and random alterations. Chromothripsis occurs commonly in various human cancers and is thought to be associated with increased malignancy and carcinogenesis. However, the causes and consequences of chromothripsis remain unclear. Therefore, to identify the mechanism underlying the generation of chromothripsis, we investigated whether chromothripsis could be artificially induced by ionizing radiation. We first elicited DNA double-strand breaks in an oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line HOC313-P and its highly metastatic subline HOC313-LM, using Single Particle Irradiation system to Cell (SPICE), a focused vertical microbeam system designed to irradiate a spot within the nuclei of adhesive cells, and then established irradiated monoclonal sublines from them, respectively. SNP array analysis detected a number of chromosomal copy number alterations (CNAs) in these sublines, and one HOC313-LM-derived monoclonal subline irradiated with 200 protons by the microbeam displayed multiple CNAs involved locally in chromosome 7. Multi-color FISH showed a complex translocation of chromosome 7 involving chromosomes 11 and 12. Furthermore, whole genome sequencing analysis revealed multiple de novo complex chromosomal rearrangements localized in chromosomes 2, 5, 7, and 20, resembling chromothripsis. These findings suggested that localized ionizing irradiation within the nucleus may induce chromothripsis-like complex chromosomal alterations via local DNA damage in the nucleus.",

			"abstract": "Big data technologies are increasingly used for biomedical and health-care informatics research. Large amounts of biological and clinical data have been generated and collected at an unprecedented speed and scale. For example, the new generation of sequencing technologies enables the processing of billions of DNA sequence data per day, and the application of electronic health records (EHRs) is documenting large amounts of patient data. The cost of acquiring and analyzing biomedical data is expected to decrease dramatically with the help of technology upgrades, such as the emergence of new sequencing machines, the development of novel hardware and software for parallel computing, and the extensive expansion of EHRs. Big data applications present new opportunities to discover new knowledge and create novel methods to improve the quality of health care. The application of big data in health care is a fast-growing field, with many new discoveries and methodologies published in the last five years. In this paper, we review and discuss big data application in four major biomedical subdisciplines: (1) bioinformatics, (2) clinical informatics, (3) imaging informatics, and (4) public health informatics. Specifically, in bioinformatics, high-throughput experiments facilitate the research of new genome-wide association studies of diseases, and with clinical informatics, the clinical field benefits from the vast amount of collected patient data for making intelligent decisions. Imaging informatics is now more rapidly integrated with cloud platforms to share medical image data and workflows, and public health informatics leverages big data techniques for predicting and monitoring infectious disease outbreaks, such as Ebola. In this paper, we review the recent progress and breakthroughs of big data applications in these health-care domains and summarize the challenges, gaps, and opportunities to improve and advance big data applications in health care.",

By understanding the differences in the drug efficacy and resistance at the level of protein-protein networks, we identified the correlation between the drug activity of oxaliplatin/5-FU and gene variations from the US National Cancer Institute-60 human cancer cell lines. The activity of either of these drugs is correlated with specific amino acid variant(s) of KRAS and other genes from the signaling pathways of colon cancer progression. We also discovered that the activity of a non-DNA-binding novel platinum drug, phosphaplatin, is comparable with oxaliplatin and 5-FU when it was tested against colon cancer cell lines. Our strategy that combines the knowledge from pharmacogenomics across cell lines with the molecular information from specific cancer cells is beneficial for predicting the outcome of a possible combination therapy for personalized treatment.",

In fact, the potential of Graphene for sensitive detection and chemical/biological free-label applications results from its exceptional physicochemical properties such as high electrical and thermal conductivity, aspect-ratio, optical transparency and remarkable mechanical and chemical stability. Herein we start by providing a general overview of the types of graphene and its derivatives, briefly describing the synthesis procedure and main properties. It follows the reference to different routes to engineer the graphene surface for sensing applications with organic biomolecules and nanoparticles for the development of advanced biosensing platforms able to detect/quantify the characteristic cancer biomolecules in biological fluids or overexpressed on cancerous cells surface with elevated sensitivity, selectivity and stability. We then describe the application of graphene in optical imaging methods such as photoluminescence and Raman imaging, electrochemical sensors for enzymatic biosensing, DNA sensing, and immunosensing. The bioquantification of cancer biomarkers and cells is finally discussed, particularly electrochemical methods such as voltammetry and amperometry which are generally adopted transducing techniques for the development of graphene based sensors for biosensing due to their simplicity, high sensitivity and low-cost. To close, we discuss the major challenges that graphene based biosensors must overcome in order to reach the necessary standards for the early detection of cancer biomarkers by providing reliable information about the patient disease stage.",

			"abstract": "Oral mucositis (OM) and radiodermatitis (RD) are serious side effects of radiotherapy (RT), often leading to its suspension, need for analgesics, and enteral/parenteral nutrition. Laser therapy is becoming a recommended treatment option. This prospective study aimed at demonstrating the beneficial effect of class IV laser therapy (HPLT) on RT-induced OM, an off-label use of HPLT to treat RD in breast cancer patients. Fifty-three cancer patients, during/after RT and/or chemotherapy (CT), affected by OM, were treated with HPLT during four consecutive days (970\u2009\u00b1\u200915 nm, 5 W (50 %), 35-6000 Hz, 240 s). Assessment of OM (Grading Objective Scale, WHO-SCALE), pain (visual analogue scale, VAS), functional ability, subjective parameters, and site/severity of OM were recorded over time. Similarly, 27 breast cancer patients affected by RD were treated by HPLT and monitored over time for grade, discomfort, itching, and bleeding. Progressive improvement of WHO-SCALE from day 7 on, and of VAS from day 2 on (p\u2009<\u20090.000) was registered. All patients' functional capacity improved on day 4 (p\u2009<\u20090.05). All subjective parameters improved on day 14 (p\u2009<\u20090.001) except for voice, which improved on day 21 (p\u2009<\u20090.000). Ulcerations' dimension and erythema's severity significantly decreased in all sites examined (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Similarly, HPLT proved to be beneficial in managing RD for all the parameters considered (p\u2009<\u20090.002). Regardless of OM grade/site and of kind/site of tumor, HPLT proved to be effective in healing OM as well as RD. In both cases, effective treatment can improve life quality through a safe, easy, innovative approach. Therefore, HPLT may become an integral part of everyday practice in the management of RT adverse effects.",

This information is obtained from public resources viz. COSMIC, CCLE and 1000-genome project. Gene essentiality data retrieved from COLT database further highlights the importance of various epigenetic proteins for cancer survival. We have also reported the sequence profiles, tertiary structures and post-translational modifications of these epigenetic proteins in cancer. It also contains information of 54 drug molecules against different epigenetic proteins. A wide range of tools have been integrated in dbEM e.g. Search, BLAST, Alignment and Profile based prediction. In our analysis, we found that epigenetic proteins DNMT3A, HDAC2, KDM6A, and TET2 are highly mutated in variety of cancers. We are confident that dbEM will be very useful in cancer research particularly in the field of epigenetic proteins based cancer therapeutics.

We previously found that RT inhibition reduces cell proliferation and promotes differentiation in neoplastic cells, indicating that high endogenous RT activity promotes cancer growth. Here we investigate the expression of L1-ORF2p in several human types of cancer.We have developed a highly specific monoclonal antibody (mAb chA1-L1) to study ORF2p expression and localization in human cancer cells and tissues.We uncover new evidence for high levels of L1-ORF2p in transformed cell lines and staged epithelial cancer tissues (colon, prostate, lung and breast) while no or only basal ORF2p expression was detected in non-transformed cells. An in-depth analysis of colon and prostate tissues shows ORF2p expression in preneoplastic stages, namely transitional mucosa and prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), respectively.Our results show that L1-ORF2p is overexpressed in tumor and in preneoplastic colon and prostate tissues; this latter finding suggests that ORF2p could be considered as a potential early diagnostic biomarker.",

We show that two distinct focal amplifications of super-enhancers 3' to MYC in lung adenocarcinoma (MYC-LASE) and endometrial carcinoma (MYC-ECSE) are physically associated with the MYC promoter and correlate with MYC overexpression. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated repression or deletion of a constituent enhancer within the MYC-LASE region led to significant reductions in the expression of MYC and its target genes and to the impairment of anchorage-independent and clonogenic growth, consistent with an oncogenic function.

These data have led to the detection of characteristic patterns of somatic mutations or \"mutation signatures\" at an unprecedented resolution, with the potential for new insights into the causes and mechanisms of tumorigenesis. Here we present new methods for modelling, identifying and visualizing such mutation signatures. Our methods greatly simplify mutation signature models compared with existing approaches, reducing the number of parameters by orders of magnitude even while increasing the contextual factors (e.g. the number of flanking bases) that are accounted for. This improves both sensitivity and robustness of inferred signatures. We also provide a new intuitive way to visualize the signatures, analogous to the use of sequence logos to visualize transcription factor binding sites. We illustrate our new method on somatic mutation data from urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract, and a larger dataset from 30 diverse cancer types. The results illustrate several important features of our methods, including the ability of our new visualization tool to clearly highlight the key features of each signature, the improved robustness of signature inferences from small sample sizes, and more detailed inference of signature characteristics such as strand biases and sequence context effects at the base two positions 5' to the mutated site. The overall framework of our work is based on probabilistic models that are closely connected with \"mixed-membership models\" which are widely used in population genetic admixture analysis, and in machine learning for document clustering. We argue that recognizing these relationships should help improve understanding of mutation signature extraction problems, and suggests ways to further improve the statistical methods. Our methods are implemented in an R package pmsignature (https://github.com/friend1ws/pmsignature) and a web application available at https://friend1ws.shinyapps.io/pmsignature_shiny/.",

The majority of newly diagnosed patients present with late stage metastatic lung cancer that is inoperable and resistant to therapies. High-throughput genomic technologies have made the identification of genetic mutations that promote lung cancer progression possible. Identification of the mutations that drive lung cancer provided new targets for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment and led to the development of targeted therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors that can be used to combat the molecular changes that promote cancer progression. Development of targeted therapies is not the only clinical benefit of gene analysis studies. Biomarkers identified from gene analysis can be used for early lung cancer detection, determine patient's prognosis and response to therapy, and monitor disease progression. Biomarkers can be used to identify the NSCLC patient population that would most benefit from treatment (targeted therapies or chemotherapies), providing clinicians tools that can be used to develop a personalized treatment plan.

			"abstract": "Targeted therapies and the consequent adoption of \"personalized\" oncology have achieved notable successes in some cancers; however, significant problems remain with this approach. Many targeted therapies are highly toxic, costs are extremely high, and most patients experience relapse after a few disease-free months. Relapses arise from genetic heterogeneity in tumors, which harbor therapy-resistant immortalized cells that have adopted alternate and compensatory pathways (i.e., pathways that are not reliant upon the same mechanisms as those which have been targeted). To address these limitations, an international task force of 180 scientists was assembled to explore the concept of a low-toxicity \"broad-spectrum\" therapeutic approach that could simultaneously target many key pathways and mechanisms. Using cancer hallmark phenotypes and the tumor microenvironment to account for the various aspects of relevant cancer biology, interdisciplinary teams reviewed each hallmark area and nominated a wide range of high-priority targets (74 in total) that could be modified to improve patient outcomes. For these targets, corresponding low-toxicity therapeutic approaches were then suggested, many of which were phytochemicals. Proposed actions on each target and all of the approaches were further reviewed for known effects on other hallmark areas and the tumor microenvironment. Potential contrary or procarcinogenic effects were found for 3.9% of the relationships between targets and hallmarks, and mixed evidence of complementary and contrary relationships was found for 7.1%. Approximately 67% of the relationships revealed potentially complementary effects, and the remainder had no known relationship. Among the approaches, 1.1% had contrary, 2.8% had mixed and 62.1% had complementary relationships. These results suggest that a broad-spectrum approach should be feasible from a safety standpoint. This novel approach has potential to be relatively inexpensive, it should help us address stages and types of cancer that lack conventional treatment, and it may reduce relapse risks. A proposed agenda for future research is offered.",

Importantly, although it supports tumorigenesis, progression and, response to treatment in MM patients, it remains one of the least understood components of malignant transformation in terms of molecular basis. Therefore these aspects make the comprehension of genomic instability a pioneering strategy for novel therapeutic and clinical speculations to use in the management of MM patients. Here we will review mechanisms mediating genomic instability in MM cells with an emphasis placed on pathogenic mutations affecting DNA recombination, replication and repair, telomere function and mitotic regulation of spindle attachment, centrosome function, and chromosomal segregation. We will discuss the mechanisms by which genetic aberrations give rise to multiple pathogenic events required for myelomagenesis and conclude with a discussion of the clinical applications of these findings in MM patients.",

			"abstract": "The closely related T-box transcription factors TBX2 and TBX3 are frequently overexpressed in melanoma and various types of human cancers, in particular, breast cancer. The overexpression of TBX2 and TBX3 can have several cellular effects, among them suppression of senescence, promotion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and invasive cell motility. In contrast, loss of function of TBX3 and most other human T-box genes causes developmental haploinsufficiency syndromes. Stephens and colleagues (1), by exome sequencing of breast tumor samples, identified five different mutations in TBX3, all affecting the DNA-binding T-domain. One in-frame deletion of a single amino acid, p.N212delN, was observed twice. Due to the clustering of these mutations to the T-domain and for statistical reasons, TBX3 was inferred to be a driver gene in breast cancer. Since mutations in the T-domain generally cause loss of function and because the tumorigenic action of TBX3 has generally been attributed to overexpression, we determined whether the putative driver mutations had loss- or gain-of-function properties. We tested two in-frame deletions, one missense, and one frameshift mutant protein for DNA-binding in vitro, and for target gene repression in cell culture. In addition, we performed an in silico analysis of somatic TBX mutations in breast cancer, collected in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Both the experimental and the in silico analysis indicate that the observed mutations predominantly cause loss of TBX3 function.",

Here we present a novel qPCR protocol that meets the conditions of extreme sensitivity and specificity that are required for detection and quantification of tumor DNA. By consecutive application of two polymerases, one of them designed for extreme base-specificity, the method reaches unprecedented sensitivity and specificity. Three qPCR assays were tested with spike-in experiments, specific for point mutations BRAF V600E, PTEN T167A and NRAS Q61L of melanoma cell lines. It was possible to detect down to one copy of tumor DNA per reaction (Poisson distribution), at a background of up to 200 000 wild type DNAs. To prove its clinical applicability, the method was successfully tested on a small cohort of BRAF V600E positive melanoma patients.",

Precision care plans still must be developed by understanding and implementing basic science research into clinical treatment. Proteomics is continuing to make major strides in the discovery of fundamental biological processes as well as more recent transition into an assay platform capable of measuring hundreds of proteins in any biological system. As such, proteomics can translate basic science discoveries into the clinical practice of precision medicine. The proteomic field has progressed at a fast rate over the past five years in technology, breadth and depth of applications in all areas of the bioscience. Some of the previously experimental technical approaches are considered the gold standard today, and the community is now trying to come to terms with the volume and complexity of the data generated.

Using mutations from 10,250 cancer genomes across 36 cancer types, we investigated clock-like mutational processes that have been operating in normal human cells. Two mutational signatures show clock-like properties. Both exhibit different mutation rates in different tissues. However, their mutation rates are not correlated, indicating that the underlying processes are subject to different biological influences. For one signature, the rate of cell division may influence its mutation rate. This study provides the first survey of clock-like mutational processes operating in human somatic cells.",

While there is undeniably a genetic component to all cancers, the accumulation of mutations with age is insufficient to explain the age-dependent increase in breast cancer incidence. In this viewpoint, we propose a multilevel framework to better understand the respective roles played by somatic mutation, microenvironment, and epigenetics making women more susceptible to breast cancer with age. The process of aging is associated with gradual breast tissue changes that not only corrupt the tumor-suppressive activity of normal tissue but also impose age-specific epigenetic changes that alter gene expression, thus reinforcing cellular phenotypes that are associated with a continuum of age-related tissue microenvironments. The evidence discussed here suggests that while the riddle of whether epigenetics drives microenvironmental changes, or whether changes in the microenvironment alter heritable cellular memory has not been solved, a path has been cleared enabling functional analysis leading to the prediction of key nodes in the network that link the microenvironment with the epigenome. The hypothesis that the accumulation of somatic mutations with age drives the age-related increase in breast cancer incidence, if correct, has a somewhat nihilistic conclusion, namely that cancers will be impossible to avoid. Alternatively, if microenvironment-driven epigenetic changes are the key to explaining susceptibility to age-related breast cancers, then there is hope that primary prevention is possible because epigenomes are relatively malleable.",

			"abstract": "Somatic mutations arise and accumulate both during tumor genesis and progression. However, the order in which mutations occur is an open question and the inference of the temporal ordering at the gene level could potentially impact on patient treatment. Thus, exploiting recent observations suggesting that the occurrence of mutations is a non-memoryless process, we developed a computational approach to infer timed oncogenetic directed acyclic graphs (TO-DAGs) from human tumor mutation data. Such graphs represent the path and the waiting times of alterations during tumor evolution. The probability of occurrence of each alteration in a path is the probability that the alteration occurs when all alterations prior to it have occurred. The waiting time between an alteration and the subsequent is modeled as a stochastic function of the conditional probability of the event given the occurrence of the previous one. TO-DAG performances have been evaluated both on synthetic data and on somatic non-silent mutations from prostate cancer and melanoma patients and then compared with those of current well-established approaches. TO-DAG shows high performance scores on synthetic data and recognizes mutations in gatekeeper tumor suppressor genes as trigger for several downstream mutational events in the human tumor data.",

CNS-HBs share some molecular similarities with pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas (PPGLs) and renal cell carcinomas (RCCs). Recently, hypoxia-inducible factors, particularly somatic HIF2A mutations, have been found to play an important role in the pathogenesis of PPGLs. Somatic mutations in HIF2A have been reported in PPGLs associated with polycythemia, which have been reported to also be present in patients with RCCs and HBs. However, whether CNS-HBs is associated with the presence of a HIF2A mutation is currently uknown. We analyzed somatic HIF2A and VHL mutations in a series of 28 sporadic CNS-HBs. We also investigated the expression of HIF target proteins and hypoxia-associated factor (HAF). Two sporadic CNS-HBs were found to have somatic HIF2A mutations. One tumor had 2 HIF2A missense mutations, one of which was previously described in a PPGL (c.1121 T>A, F374Y). The second patient had coexistence of somatic truncated mutations (c.1669 C>T, Q557*) in HIF2A together with a VHL mutation. Neither of the two patients had polycythemia at the time of diagnosis. We demonstrate that the novel truncated mutation in HIF2A (Q557*) affects HIF-2\u03b1 prolyl hydroxylation with its reduced ubiquitination but intact transcriptional activity, resulting in an activating effect. Both CNS-HB samples showed positive expression of VEGFR2/CA9/Glut1 and HAF. Our data support the unique central role of the VHL/HIF-2\u03b1 signaling pathway in the molecular pathogenesis of CNS-HBs and show for the first time the presence of HIF2A mutations in sporadic HB.",

Metastasis results in a poor prognosis and increased mortality, but the molecular mechanisms by which metastatic tumors occur are not well understood. Identifying the genes that drive the metastatic process could provide targets for improved therapy and biomarkers to improve BC patient outcomes. Using a forward mutagenesis screen, BC cells mutagenized with a replication-incompetent gammaretroviral vector (\u03b3RV) were xenotransplanted into the mammary fat pad of immunodeficient mice. In this approach the vector provirus dysregulates nearby genes, providing a selective advantage to transduced cells to form metastases. Metastatic tumors were analyzed for proviral integration sites to identify nearby candidate metastasis genes. The \u03b3RV has a transgene cassette that allows for rescue in bacteria and rapid identification of vector integration sites. Using this approach, we identified the previously described metastasis gene WWTR1 (TAZ), and three other novel candidate metastasis genes including SHARPIN. SHARPIN was independently validated in vivo as a BC metastasis gene. Analysis of patient data showed that SHARPIN expression predicts metastasis-free survival after adjuvant therapy. Our approach has broad potential to identify genes involved in oncogenic processes for BC and other cancers. We show here it can identify both known (WWTR1) and novel (SHARPIN) BC metastasis genes.",

Herein, we present a highly illustrated review of seven portals, i.e., Tumorscape, UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser, ICGC Data Portal, COSMIC, cBioPortal, IntOGen, and BioProfiling.de. All of the selected portals are user-friendly and can be exploited by scientists from different cancer-associated fields, including those without bioinformatics background. It is expected that the use of the portals will contribute to a better understanding of cancer molecular etiology and will ultimately accelerate the translation of genomic knowledge into clinical practice.",

			"abstract": "Rapidly accruing knowledge of the mutational landscape of malignant neoplasms, the increasing facility of massively parallel genomic sequencing, and the availability of drugs targeting many \"driver\" molecular abnormalities have spurred the oncologic community to consider how to use these new tools to improve cancer treatment. In order to assure that assignment of patients to a particular targeted treatment is likely to be beneficial to the patient, it will be necessary to conduct appropriate clinical research. It is clear that clinical (histology and stage) eligibility criteria are not sufficient for most clinical trials using agents that target mutations that are present in only a minority of patients. Recently, several clinical trial designs have been suggested to test the benefit of targeted treatment in molecular and/or clinical subgroups of patients. However, challenges remain in the implementation of such trials, including choice of assay, levels of evidence regarding gene variants, tumor heterogeneity, identifying resistance mechanisms, the necessity of screening large numbers of patients, infrastructure needs, and collaboration of investigators and industry. This article reviews current trial designs and discusses some of the considerations, advantages, and drawbacks of designing clinical trials that depend on particular molecular variants as eligibility criteria.",

However, many mutations found in cancer might not be major drivers or 'passenger' mutations, but instead might have relatively weak tumour-promoting effects. Our aim is to highlight the existence of these mutations (termed 'mini drivers' herein), as multiple mini-driver mutations might substitute for a major-driver change, especially in the presence of genomic instability or high mutagen exposure. The mini-driver model has clinical implications: for example, the effects of therapeutically targeting such genes may be limited. However, the main importance of the model lies in helping to provide a complete understanding of tumorigenesis, especially as we anticipate that an increasing number of mini-driver mutations will be found by cancer genome sequencing.",

Experimental investigations of the mutations and mutation spectra induced by environmental mutagens have traditionally focused on single genes. With the advent of faster cheaper sequencing platforms, it is now possible to assess mutation spectra in experimental models across the whole genome. As a proof of principle, we have examined the whole genome mutation profiles of mouse embryo fibroblasts immortalised following exposure to benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), ultraviolet light (UV) and aristolochic acid (AA). The results reveal that each mutagen induces a characteristic mutation signature: predominantly G\u2192T mutations for BaP, C\u2192T and CC\u2192TT for UV and A\u2192T for AA. The data are not only consistent with existing knowledge but also provide additional information at higher levels of genomic organisation. The approach holds promise for identifying agents responsible for mutations in human tumours and for shedding light on the aetiology of human cancer.",

Largely due to lack of suitable model systems, the mechanistic basis of chromothripsis has remained elusive. We developed an integrative method termed \"complex alterations after selection and transformation (CAST),\" enabling efficient in vitro generation of complex DNA rearrangements including chromothripsis, using cell perturbations coupled with a strong selection barrier followed by massively parallel sequencing. We employed this methodology to characterize catastrophic SR formation processes, their temporal sequence, and their impact on gene expression and cell division. Our in vitro system uncovered a propensity of chromothripsis to occur in cells with damaged telomeres, and in particular in hyperploid cells. Analysis of primary medulloblastoma cancer genomes verified the link between hyperploidy and chromothripsis in vivo. CAST provides the foundation for mechanistic dissection of complex DNA rearrangement processes.",

With an ever increasing number of clinically significant mutations identified, tumour genetic diagnostics is moving from single to multigene analysis.

To optimise our diagnostic workflow, we evaluated three target enrichment strategies using two next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms (Illumina MiSeq and Ion PGM). The target enrichment strategies were Fluidigm Access Array custom amplicon panel including 13 genes (MiSeq sequencing), the Oxford Gene Technologies (OGT) SureSeq Solid Tumour hybridisation panel including 60 genes (MiSeq sequencing), and an Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel including 50 genes (Ion PGM sequencing). DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks of eight previously characterised cancer cell lines was tested using the three panels. Matching genomic DNA from fresh cultures of these cell lines was also tested using the custom Fluidigm panel and the OGT SureSeq Solid Tumour panel. Each panel allowed mutation detection of core cancer genes including KRAS, BRAF, and EGFR. Our results indicate that the panels enable accurate variant detection despite sequencing from FFPE DNA.",

We hypothesized that interindividual response variability is partially dependent on somatic DNA copy number alterations (SCNAs), particularly those of genes encoding the protein tyrosines targeted by MTKI (called target genes). Genomic alterations were investigated in MTKI responsive and non responsive patients with different histological subtypes included in the ProfiLER protocol (NCT 01774409). From March 2013 to August 2014, 58 patients with advanced cancer treated with one of 7 MTKIs were included in the ProfiLER trial and split into one discovery cohort (n = 13), and 2 validation cohorts (n = 12 and 33). An analysis of the copy number alterations of kinase-coding genes for each of 7 MTKIs was conducted. A prediction algorithm (SUMSCAN) based on the presence of specific gene gains (Tumor Target Charge, TTC) and losses (Tumor Target Losses, TTL) was conceived and validated in 2 independent validation cohorts. MTKI sensitive tumors present a characteristic SCNA profile including a global gain profile, and specific gains for target genes while MTKI resistant tumors present the opposite. SUMSCAN favorable patients achieved longer progression-free and overall survival. This work shows that the copy number sum of kinase-coding genes enables the prediction of response of cancer patients to MTKI, opening a novel paradigm for the treatment selection of these patients.",

Although genomic landscape studies are informative for individual cancer types, a comprehensive comparative study of tumorigenic mutations across cancer types based on integrative data sources is still a pressing need. We systematically analyzed ~10(6) non-synonymous mutations extracted from COSMIC, involving ~8000 genome-wide screened samples across 23 major human cancers at both the amino acid and gene levels. Our analysis identified cancer-specific heterogeneity that traditional nucleotide variation analysis alone usually overlooked. Particularly, the amino acid arginine (R) turns out to be the most favorable target of amino acid alteration in most cancer types studied (P\u2009<\u200910(-9), binomial test), reflecting its important role in cellular physiology. The tumor suppressor gene TP53 is mutated exclusively with the HYDIN, KRAS, and PTEN genes in large intestine, lung, and endometrial cancers respectively, indicating that TP53 takes part in different signaling pathways in different cancers. While some of our analyses corroborated previous observations, others indicated relevant candidates with high priority for further experimental validation. Our findings have many ramifications in understanding the etiology of cancer and the underlying molecular mechanisms in particular cancers.",

			"abstract": "It has been a consensus in cancer research that cancer is a disease caused primarily by genomic alterations, especially somatic mutations. However, the mechanism of mutation-induced oncogenesis is not fully understood. Here, we used the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway as a case study and performed a systematic analysis of integrating pathway dynamics with protein interaction kinetics to quantitatively investigate the causal molecular mechanism of mutation-induced oncogenesis. A mathematical model of the regulatory network was constructed to establish the functional role of dynamic bifurcation in the apoptotic process. The oncogenic mutation enrichment of each of the protein functional domains involved was found strongly correlated with the parameter sensitivity of the bifurcation point. We further dissected the causal mechanism underlying this correlation by evaluating the mutational influence on protein interaction kinetics using molecular dynamics simulation. We analyzed 29 matched mutant-wild-type and 16 matched SNP--wild-type protein systems. We found that the binding kinetics changes reflected by the changes of free energy changes induced by protein interaction mutations, which induce variations in the sensitive parameters of the bifurcation point, were a major cause of apoptosis pathway dysfunction, and mutations involved in sensitive interaction domains show high oncogenic potential. Our analysis provided a molecular basis for connecting protein mutations, protein interaction kinetics, network dynamics properties, and physiological function of a regulatory network. These insights provide a framework for coupling mutation genotype to tumorigenesis phenotype and help elucidate the logic of cancer initiation.",

This region harbours the tumor suppressor gene prefoldin subunit 5 (PFDN5) and the deletion correlated with a higher Ki-67 score. PFDN5 has been described to repress c-MYC and is, therefore, a candidate tumor-suppressor and cancer-driver gene in canine mammary cancer. Aim of this study was to confirm the recurrent deletion in a larger number of tumors.",

			"abstract": "Cancers detected at a late stage are often refractory to treatments and ultimately lethal. Early detection can significantly increase survival probability, but attempts to reduce mortality by early detection have frequently increased overdiagnosis of indolent conditions that do not progress over a lifetime. Study designs that incorporate biomarker trajectories in time and space are needed to distinguish patients who progress to an early cancer from those who follow an indolent course. Esophageal adenocarcinoma is characterized by evolution of punctuated and catastrophic somatic chromosomal alterations and high levels of overall mutations but few recurrently mutated genes aside from TP53. Endoscopic surveillance of Barrett's esophagus for early cancer detection provides an opportunity for assessment of alterations for cancer risk in patients who progress to esophageal adenocarcinoma compared with nonprogressors. We investigated 1,272 longitudinally collected esophageal biopsies in a 248 Barrett's patient case-cohort study with 20,425 person-months of follow-up, including 79 who progressed to early-stage esophageal adenocarcinoma. Cancer progression risk was assessed for total chromosomal alterations, diversity, and chromosomal region-specific alterations measured with single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays in biopsies obtained over esophageal space and time. A model using 29 chromosomal features was developed for cancer risk prediction (area under receiver operator curve, 0.94). The model prediction performance was robust in two independent esophageal adenocarcinoma sets and outperformed TP53 mutation, flow cytometric DNA content, and histopathologic diagnosis of dysplasia. This study offers a strategy to reduce overdiagnosis in Barrett's esophagus and improve early detection of esophageal adenocarcinoma and potentially other cancers characterized by punctuated and catastrophic chromosomal evolution.",

We currently lack quantitative theory for how preventive measures and post-diagnostic interventions are predicted to affect risks of a life threatening cancer. Here we evaluate how continuous measures, such as life style changes and traditional treatments, affect both neoplastic growth and the frequency of resistant clones. We then compare and contrast preventive and post-diagnostic interventions assuming that only a single lesion progresses to invasive carcinoma during the life of an individual, and resection either leaves residual cells or metastases are undetected. Whereas prevention generally results in more positive therapeutic outcomes than post-diagnostic interventions, this advantage is substantially lowered should prevention initially fail to arrest tumour growth. We discuss these results and other important mitigating factors that should be taken into consideration in a comparative understanding of preventive and post-diagnostic interventions.",

			"abstract": "Cancer, like many common disorders, has a complex etiology, often with a strong genetic component and with multiple environmental factors contributing to susceptibility. A considerable number of genomic variants have been previously reported to be causative of, or associated with, an increased risk for various types of cancer. Here, we adopted a next-generation sequencing approach in 11 members of two families of Greek descent to identify all genomic variants with the potential to predispose family members to cancer. Cross-comparison with data from the Human Gene Mutation Database identified a total of 571 variants, from which 47\u00a0% were disease-associated polymorphisms, 26\u00a0% disease-associated polymorphisms with additional supporting functional evidence, 19\u00a0% functional polymorphisms with in vitro/laboratory or in vivo supporting evidence but no known disease association, 4\u00a0% putative disease-causing mutations but with some residual doubt as to their pathological significance, and 3\u00a0% disease-causing mutations. Subsequent analysis, focused on the latter variant class most likely to be involved in cancer predisposition, revealed two variants of prime interest, namely MSH2 c.2732T>A (p.L911R) and BRCA1 c.2955delC, the first of which is novel. KMT2D c.13895delC and c.1940C>A variants are additionally reported as incidental findings. The next-generation sequencing-based family genomics approach described herein has the potential to be applied to other types of complex genetic disorder in order to identify variants of potential pathological significance.",

			"abstract": "The recent FDA approval of the MiSeqDx platform provides a unique opportunity to develop targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) panels for human disease, including cancer. We have developed a scalable, targeted panel-based assay termed UNCseq, which involves a NGS panel of over 200 cancer-associated genes and a standardized downstream bioinformatics pipeline for detection of single nucleotide variations (SNV) as well as small insertions and deletions (indel). In addition, we developed a novel algorithm, NGScopy, designed for samples with sparse sequencing coverage to detect large-scale copy number variations (CNV), similar to human SNP Array 6.0 as well as small-scale intragenic CNV. Overall, we applied this assay to 100 snap-frozen lung cancer specimens lacking same-patient germline DNA (07-0120 tissue cohort) and validated our results against Sanger sequencing, SNP Array, and our recently published integrated DNA-seq/RNA-seq assay, UNCqeR, where RNA-seq of same-patient tumor specimens confirmed SNV detected by DNA-seq, if RNA-seq coverage depth was adequate. In addition, we applied the UNCseq assay on an independent lung cancer tumor tissue collection with available same-patient germline DNA (11-1115 tissue cohort) and confirmed mutations using assays performed in a CLIA-certified laboratory. We conclude that UNCseq can identify SNV, indel, and CNV in tumor specimens lacking germline DNA in a cost-efficient fashion.",

We report that a fusion event involving normal, nontransformed, cytogenetically stable epithelial cells can initiate chromosomal instability, DNA damage, cell transformation, and malignancy. Clonal analysis of fused cells reveals that the karyotypic and phenotypic potential of tumors formed by cell fusion is established immediately or within a few cell divisions after the fusion event, without further ongoing genetic and phenotypic plasticity, and that subsequent evolution of such tumors reflects selection from the initial diverse population rather than ongoing plasticity of the progeny.

Integrated genomic analyses have shown that the mutation status of PCC/PGL susceptibility genes strongly correlates with multi-omics data.

Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a form of GIN that involves frequent cytogenetic changes leading to changes in chromosome copy number (aneuploidy). While both CIN and aneuploidy are common characteristics of cancer cells, their roles in tumor initiation and progression are unclear. On the one hand, CIN and aneuploidy are known to provide genetic variation to allow cells to adapt in changing environments such as nutrient fluctuations and hypoxia. Patients with constitutive aneuploidies are more susceptible to certain types of cancers, suggesting that changes in chromosome copy number could positively contribute to cancer evolution. On the other hand, chromosomal imbalances have been observed to have detrimental effects on cellular fitness and might trigger cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Furthermore, mouse models for CIN have led to conflicting results. Taken together these findings suggest that the relationship between CIN, aneuploidy and cancer is more complex than what was previously anticipated. Here we review what is known about this complex m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois, discuss recent evidence suggesting that aneuploidy, CIN and GIN together promote a vicious cycle of genome chaos. Lastly, we propose a working hypothesis to reconcile the conflicting observations regarding the role of aneuploidy and CIN in tumorigenesis.",

CEMP1 transfection into non-osteogenic cells such as adult human gingival fibroblasts results in differentiation of these cells into a \"mineralizing\" cell phenotype. Other studies have shown evidence that CEMP1 could have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of bone defects and regeneration of other mineralized tissues. To better understand CEMP1's biological effects in vitro we investigated the consequences of its expression in human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) growing in non-mineralizing media by comparing gene expression profiles. We identified several mRNAs whose expression is modified by CEMP1 induction in HGF cells. Enrichment analysis showed that several of these newly expressed genes are involved in oncogenesis. Our results suggest that CEMP1 causes the transformation of HGF and NIH3T3 cells. CEMP1 is overexpressed in cancer cell lines. We also determined that the region spanning the CEMP1 locus is commonly amplified in a variety of cancers, and finally we found significant overexpression of CEMP1 in leukemia, cervix, breast, prostate and lung cancer. Our findings suggest that CEMP1 exerts modulation of a number of cellular genes, cellular development, cellular growth, cell death, and cell cycle, and molecules associated with cancer.",

			"abstract": "DNA damage in somatic cells originates from both environmental and endogenous sources, giving rise to mutations through multiple mechanisms. When these mutations affect the function of critical genes, cancer may ensue. Although identifying genomic subsets of mutated genes may inform therapeutic options, a systematic survey of tumor mutational spectra is required to improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of mutagenesis involved in cancer etiology. Recent studies have presented genome-wide sets of somatic mutations as a 96-element vector, a procedure that only captures the immediate neighbors of the mutated nucleotide. Herein, we present a 32 \u00d7 12 mutation matrix that captures the nucleotide pattern two nucleotides upstream and downstream of the mutation. A somatic autosomal mutation matrix (SAMM) was constructed from tumor-specific mutations derived from each of 909 individual cancer genomes harboring a total of 10,681,843 single-base substitutions. In addition, mechanistic template mutation matrices (MTMMs) representing oxidative DNA damage, ultraviolet-induced DNA damage, (5m)CpG deamination, and APOBEC-mediated cytosine mutation, are presented. MTMMs were mapped to the individual tumor SAMMs to determine the maximum contribution of each mutational mechanism to the overall mutation pattern. A Manhattan distance across all SAMM elements between any two tumor genomes was used to determine their relative distance. Employing this metric, 89.5% of all tumor genomes were found to have a nearest neighbor from the same tissue of origin. When a distance-dependent 6-nearest neighbor classifier was used, 10.4% of the SAMMs had an Undetermined tissue of origin, and 92.2% of the remaining SAMMs were assigned to the correct tissue of origin. [corrected]. Thus, although tumors from different tissues may have similar mutation patterns, their SAMMs often display signatures that are characteristic of specific tissues.",

Here, we demonstrate that hypoxia induces transient site-specific copy gains (TSSGs) in primary, nontransformed, and transformed human cells. Hypoxia-driven copy gains are not dependent on HIF1\u03b1 or HIF2\u03b1; however, they are dependent on the KDM4A histone demethylase and are blocked by inhibition of KDM4A with a small molecule or the natural metabolite succinate. Furthermore, this response is conserved at a syntenic region in zebrafish cells. Regions with site-specific copy gain are also enriched for amplifications in hypoxic primary tumors. These tumors exhibited amplification and overexpression of the drug resistance gene CKS1B, which we recapitulated in hypoxic breast cancer cells. Our results demonstrate that hypoxia provides a biological stimulus to create transient site-specific copy alterations that could result in heterogeneity within tumors and cell populations. These findings have major implications in our understanding of copy number heterogeneity and the emergence of drug resistance genes in cancer.",

Recent molecular and imaging insights into radiobiology will provide a unique opportunity for rational patient treatment, enabling the parallel design of next-generation trials that formally examine the therapeutic outcome of adding targeted drugs to radiation, together with the critically important assessment of radiation volume and dose-limiting treatment toxicities. In considering the use of systemic agents with presumed radiosensitizing activity, this may also include the identification of molecular, metabolic and imaging markers of treatment response and tolerability, and will need particular attention on patient eligibility. In addition to providing an overview of clinical biomarker studies relevant for personalized radiotherapy, this communication will highlight principles in addressing clinical evaluation of combined-modality-targeted therapeutics and radiation. The increasing number of translational studies that bridge large-scale omics sciences with quality-assured phenomics end points-given the imperative development of open-source data repositories to allow investigators the access to the complex data sets-will enable radiation oncology to continue to position itself with the highest level of evidence within existing clinical practice.",

With increasing efforts to personalize cancer medicine, comprehensive genome analyses will find its way into daily clinical routine in pediatric oncology. Whole genome and exome sequencing unavoidably generates incidental findings. The somatic \"molecular make-up\" of a tumor genome may suggest a germline mutation in a cancer susceptibility syndrome. At least two mechanisms are well-known, (a) chromothripsis (Li-Fraumeni syndrome) and (b) a high total number of mutational events which exceeds that of other samples of the same tumor type (defective DNA mismatch repair). Hence, pediatricians are faced with the fact that genetic events within the tumor genome itself can point toward underlying germline cancer susceptibility. Whenever genetic testing including next-generation sequencing (NGS) is initiated, the pediatrician has to inform about the benefits, risks, and alternatives, discuss the possibility of incidental findings and its disclosure, and to obtain informed consent prior to testing.",

			"abstract": "The current understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to cancer is not sufficient to explain the loss or gain of function in proteins related to tumorigenic processes. Among them, more than 100 oncogenes, 20-30 tumor-suppressor genes, and hundreds of genes participating in DNA repair and replication have been found to play a role in the origins of cancer over the last 25\u2009years. The phosphorylation of serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues is a critical step in cellular growth and development and is achieved through the tight regulation of protein kinases. Phosphorylation plays a major role in eukaryotic signaling as kinase domains are found in 2% of our genes. The deregulation of kinase control mechanisms has disastrous consequences, often leading to gains of function, cell transformation, and cancer. The c-Abl kinase protein is one of the most studied targets in the fight against cancer and is a hotspot for drug development because it participates in several solid tumors and is the hallmark of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Tumor suppressors have the opposite effects. Their fundamental role in the maintenance of genomic integrity has awarded them a role as the guardians of DNA. Among the tumor suppressors, p53 is the most studied. The p53 protein has been shown to be a transcription factor that recognizes and binds to specific DNA response elements and activates gene transcription. Stress triggered by ionizing radiation or other mutagenic events leads to p53 phosphorylation and cell-cycle arrest, senescence, or programed cell death. The p53 gene is the most frequently mutated gene in cancer. Mutations in the DNA-binding domain are classified as class I or class II depending on whether substitutions occur in the DNA contact sites or in the protein core, respectively. Tumor-associated p53 mutations often lead to the loss of protein function, but recent investigations have also indicated gain-of-function mutations. The prion-like aggregation of mutant p53 is associated with loss-of-function, dominant-negative, and gain-of-function effects. In the current review, we focused on the most recent insights into the protein structure and function of the c-Abl and p53 proteins that will provide us guidance to understand the loss and gain of function of these misfolded tumor-associated proteins.",

			"abstract": "Proliferation is an important part of cancer development and progression. This is manifest by altered expression and/or activity of cell cycle related proteins. Constitutive activation of many signal transduction pathways also stimulates cell growth. Early steps in tumor development are associated with a fibrogenic response and the development of a hypoxic environment which favors the survival and proliferation of cancer stem cells. Part of the survival strategy of cancer stem cells may manifested by alterations in cell metabolism. Once tumors appear, growth and metastasis may be supported by overproduction of appropriate hormones (in hormonally dependent cancers), by promoting angiogenesis, by undergoing epithelial to mesenchymal transition, by triggering autophagy, and by taking cues from surrounding stromal cells. A number of natural compounds (e.g., curcumin, resveratrol, indole-3-carbinol, brassinin, sulforaphane, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, genistein, ellagitannins, lycopene and quercetin) have been found to inhibit one or more pathways that contribute to proliferation (e.g., hypoxia inducible factor 1, nuclear factor kappa B, phosphoinositide 3 kinase/Akt, insulin-like growth factor receptor 1, Wnt, cell cycle associated proteins, as well as androgen and estrogen receptor signaling). These data, in combination with bioinformatics analyses, will be very important for identifying signaling pathways and molecular targets that may provide early diagnostic markers and/or critical targets for the development of new drugs or drug combinations that block tumor formation and progression.",

However, while the functional characterization of short non-coding RNAs has been reaching maturity, there is still a paucity of well characterized long noncoding RNAs, even though large studies in recent years are rapidly increasing the number of annotated ones. The long noncoding RNA PVT1 is encoded by a gene that has been long known since it resides in the well-known cancer risk region 8q24. However, a couple of accidental concurrent conditions have slowed down the study of this gene, that is, a preconception on the primacy of the protein-coding over noncoding RNAs and the prevalent interest in its neighbor MYC oncogene. Recent studies have brought PVT1 under the spotlight suggesting interesting models of functioning, such as competing endogenous RNA activity and regulation of protein stability of important oncogenes, primarily of the MYC oncogene. Despite some advancements in modelling the PVT1 role in cancer, there are many questions that remain unanswered concerning the precise molecular mechanisms underlying its functioning.",

While special attention has been paid to false positives in variant or mutation calling from single-cell sequencing data, an equally important but often neglected issue is that of false negatives derived from allele dropout during the amplification of single cell genomes. In this paper, we propose a simple strategy to reduce the false negatives in single-cell sequencing data analysis. Simulation results show that this method is highly reliable, with an error rate of 4.94\u00d710-5, which is orders of magnitude lower than the expected false negative rate (~34%) estimated from a single-cell exome dataset, though the method is limited by the low SNP density in the human genome. We applied this method to analyze the exome data of a few dozen single tumor cells generated in previous studies, and extracted cell specific mutation information for a small set of sites. Interestingly, we found that there are difficulties in using the classical clonal model of tumor cell growth to explain the mutation patterns observed in some tumor cells.",

Whereas the historical trend will certainly be into the general direction of personalized diagnostics and cures, the temperate view suggests that biomedical applications that rely either on the comparison of biomolecular sequences and/or on the already known biomolecular mechanisms have much greater chances to enter clinical practice soon. In addition to considering the general trends, we exemplarily review advances in the area of cancer biomarker discovery, in the clinically relevant characterization of patient-specific viral and bacterial pathogens (with emphasis on drug selection for influenza and enterohemorrhagic E. coli) as well as progress in the automated assessment of histopathological images.

However, there is limited information on somatic mutations in non-coding regions including untranslated regions, introns, regulatory elements and non-coding RNAs, and rearrangements, sometimes producing fusion genes, and pathogen detection in cancer genomes remain widely unexplored. WGS approaches can detect these unexplored mutations, as well as coding mutations and somatic copy number alterations, and help us to better understand the whole landscape of cancer genomes and elucidate functions of these unexplored genomic regions. Analysis of cancer genomes using the present WGS platforms is still primitive and there are substantial improvements to be made in sequencing technologies, informatics and computer resources.

However, even in unstressed cells, DNA undergoes a plethora of spontaneous alterations provoked by its inherent chemical instability and the intracellular milieu. Base excision repair (BER) is the major cellular pathway responsible for repair of these lesions, and as deficiency in BER activity results in DNA damage it has been proposed that it may trigger the development of sporadic cancers. Nevertheless, experimental evidence for this model remains inconsistent and elusive. Here, we performed a proteomic analysis of BER deficient human cells using stable isotope labelling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), and demonstrate that BER deficiency, which induces genetic instability, results in dramatic changes in gene expression, resembling changes found in many cancers. We observed profound alterations in tissue homeostasis, serine biosynthesis, and one-carbon- and amino acid metabolism, all of which have been identified as cancer cell 'hallmarks'. For the first time, this study describes gene expression changes characteristic for cells deficient in repair of endogenous DNA lesions by BER. These expression changes resemble those observed in cancer cells, suggesting that genetically unstable BER deficient cells may be a source of pre-cancerous cells.",

Current elastic net model utilized a sure independence screening to select relevant genomic features with drug response, but it may neglect the combination effect of some marginally weak features. In this work, we applied an iterative sure independence screening scheme to select drug response relevant features from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) dataset. For each drug in CCLE, we selected up to 40 features including gene expressions, mutation and copy number alterations of cancer-related genes, and some of them are significantly strong features but showing weak marginal correlation with drug response vector. Lasso regression based on the selected features showed that our prediction accuracies are higher than those by elastic net regression for most drugs.",

			"abstract": "SWI/SNF is a major regulator of gene expression. Its role is to facilitate the shifting and exposure of DNA segments within the promoter and other key domains to transcription factors and other essential cellular proteins. This complex interacts with a wide range of proteins and does not function within a single, specific pathway; thus, it is involved in a multitude of cellular processes, including DNA repair, differentiation, development, cell adhesion, and growth control. Given SWI/SNF's prominent role in these processes, many of which are important for blocking cancer development, it is not surprising that the SWI/SNF complex is targeted during cancer initiation and progression both by mutations and by non-mutational mechanisms. Currently, the understanding of the types of alterations, their frequency, and their impact on the SWI/SNF subunits is an area of intense research that has been bolstered by a recent cadre of NextGen sequencing studies. These studies have revealed mutations in SWI/SNF subunits, indicating that this complex is thus important for cancer development. The purpose of this review is to put into perspective the role of mutations versus other mechanisms in the silencing of SWI/SNF subunits, in particular, BRG1 and BRM. In addition, this review explores the recent development of synthetic lethality and how it applies to this complex, as well as how BRM polymorphisms are becoming recognized as potential clinical biomarkers for cancer risk.",

Revisiting the experimental contexts that inspired these discoveries helps explain confounding biases that inevitably accompany such discoveries. Amending early biases has added a newcomer to the collection of cell death models. Analysis of gene-dependent death in yeast revealed the surprising influence of single gene mutations on subsequent eukaryotic genome evolution. Similar events may influence the selection for mutations during early tumorigenesis. The possibility that any early random mutation might drive the selection for a cancer driver mutation is conceivable but difficult to demonstrate. This was tested in yeast, revealing that mutation of almost any gene appears to specify the selection for a new second mutation. Some human tumors contain pairs of mutant genes homologous to co-occurring mutant genes in yeast. Here we consider how yeast again provide novel insights into tumorigenesis.",

A large body of work has focused on the activation of the ER stress response in cancer cells to facilitate their survival and tumor growth; however, there are some studies suggesting that the ER stress response can also mitigate cancer progression. Despite these contradictions, it is clear that the ER stress response is closely associated with cancer biology. The ER stress response classically encompasses activation of three separate pathways, which are collectively categorized the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR has been extensively studied in various cancers and appears to confer a selective advantage to tumor cells to facilitate their enhanced growth and resistance to anti-cancer agents. It has also been shown that ER stress induces chromatin changes, which can also facilitate cell survival. Chromatin remodeling has been linked with many cancers through repression of tumor suppressor and apoptosis genes. Interplay between the classic UPR and genome damage repair mechanisms may have important implications in the transformation process of normal cells into cancer cells.",

In recent years, the use of next-generation sequencing techniques has uncovered new and, in some cases, unexpected driver genes with prognostic and therapeutic value. The mutational landscape of CLL is characterized by high-genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity, low mutation recurrence and a long tail of cases with undefined driver genes. On the other hand, the use of deep sequencing has also revealed high intra-tumor heterogeneity and provided a detailed picture of clonal evolution processes. This phenomenon, in which aberrant DNA methylation can also participate, appears to be tightly associated to poor outcomes and chemo-refractoriness, thus providing a new subject for therapeutic intervention. Hence, and having in mind the limitations derived from the CLL complexity thus described, the application of massively parallel sequencing studies has unveiled a wealth of information that is expected to substantially improve patient staging schemes and CLL clinical management.",

However, the approach to identify such driver genes is facing significant challenges due to the genomically heterogenous nature of HCC. Here we tested whether the integrative genomic profiling of a well-defined HCC subset that is classified by an extreme EpCAM(+) AFP(+) gene expression signature and associated with poor prognosis, all attributes of a stem cell-like phenotype, could uncover survival-related driver genes in HCC. Following transcriptomic analysis of the well-defined HCC cases, a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis coupled with genomic copy number alteration assessment revealed that YY1-associated protein 1 (YY1AP1) is a critical oncoprotein specifically activated in EpCAM(+) AFP(+) HCC. YY1AP1 silencing eliminates oncogene addiction by altering the chromatin landscape and triggering massive apoptosis in vitro and tumor suppression in vivo. YY1AP1 expression promotes HCC proliferation and is required for the maintenance of stem cell features. We revealed that YY1AP1 cooperates with YY1 to alter the chromatin landscape and activate transcription of stemness regulators. Thus YY1AP1 may serve as a key molecular target for EpCAM(+) AFP(+) HCC subtype. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and power of a new strategy by utilizing well-defined patient samples and integrative genomics to uncover critical pathways linked to HCC subtypes with prognostic impact.",

Indeed, therapy resistance has become a key challenge for global health. Therefore, ideas of how to control evolving populations to overcome this threat are valuable. Here we use the mathematical concepts of stochastic optimal control to study what is needed to control evolving populations. Following established routes to calculate control strategies, we first study how a polymorphism can be maintained in a finite population by adaptively tuning selection. We then introduce a minimal model of drug resistance in a stochastically evolving cancer cell population and compute adaptive therapies. When decisions are in this manner based on monitoring the response of the tumor, this can outperform established therapy paradigms. For both case studies, we demonstrate the importance of high-resolution monitoring of the target population to achieve a given control objective, thus quantifying the intuition that to control, one must monitor.",

In particular, distinguishing the unique complement of genes that drive tumorigenesis in each patient from a sea of passenger mutations is necessary for translating the full benefit of cancer genome sequencing into the clinic. We address this need by presenting a data integration framework (OncoIMPACT) to nominate patient-specific driver genes based on their phenotypic impact. Extensive in silico and in vitro validation helped establish OncoIMPACT's robustness, improved precision over competing approaches and verifiable patient and cell line specific predictions (2/2 and 6/7 true positives and negatives, respectively). In particular, we computationally predicted and experimentally validated the gene TRIM24 as a putative novel amplified driver in a melanoma patient. Applying OncoIMPACT to more than 1000 tumor samples, we generated patient-specific driver gene lists in five different cancer types to identify modes of synergistic action. We also provide the first demonstration that computationally derived driver mutation signatures can be overall superior to single gene and gene expression based signatures in enabling patient stratification and prognostication.

However, how many such mutations are required for a normal human cell to progress to an advanced cancer?

For example, the classic studies of Nordling [Nordling CO (1953) Br J Cancer 7(1):68-72] and Armitage and Doll [Armitage P, Doll R (1954) Br J Cancer 8(1):1-12] suggest that six or seven sequential mutations are required. Here, we describe a different approach to derive this estimate that combines conventional epidemiologic studies with genome-wide sequencing data: incidence data for different groups of patients with the same cancer type were compared with respect to their somatic mutation rates. In two well-documented cancer types (lung and colon adenocarcinomas), we find that only three sequential mutations are required to develop cancer.

			"abstract": "Over the last fifty years there has been an explosion of biological data, leading to the realization that to fully explain biological mechanisms it is necessary to interpret them as complex dynamical systems. The first stage of this interpretation is to determine which components (proteins, genes or metabolites) of the system interact. This is usually represented by a graph, or network. The behavior of this network can then be investigated using mathematical modeling. In vivo these biological networks show several remarkable (and seemingly paradoxical) properties including robustness, plasticity and sensitivity. Erroneous behavior of these networks is often associated with disease. Hence understanding the system-level properties can have important implications for the treatment of disease. Systems biology is an organized approach to quantitatively describe and elucidate the behavior of these complex networks. This review focuses on the progress and future challenges of a systems approach to biology.",

Although recent advances in pre- and neonatal diagnosis as well as in surgical procedures have reduced the morbidity and mortality for many CHD, the etiology for CHD remains undefined. In non-syndromic and isolated (without a familial history or a Mendelian inheritance) forms of CHDs, a multifactorial pathogenesis with interplay between inherited and non-inherited causes is recognized. In this paper, we discuss the current knowledge of the potential molecular mechanisms, mediating abnormal cardiac development in non-syndromic and isolated CHD, including mutations in cardiac transcription factors, the role of somatic mutations and epigenetic alterations as well as the influence of gene-environment interactions. In the near future, the advent of high-throughput genomic technologies with the integration of system biology will expand our understanding of isolated, non-syndromic CHDs for their prevention, early diagnosis and therapy.",

			"abstract": "The study aims to identify novel gene mutations in osteosarcoma and to guide individualized preoperative chemotherapy for osteosarcoma based on the analysis of expression and mutations of the drug-metabolism-related genes. Twenty-eight osteosarcoma patients received individualized preoperative chemotherapy regimens. Expression levels and mutations of chemotherapy-related genes in samples collected from the patients were determined using real-time PCR and DNA sequencing, respectively. Patient sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents was evaluated by systematic analysis of the PCR and sequencing results. Novel mutations were identified via high-throughput sequencing of 339 genes in 10 osteosarcoma samples. Individualized preoperative chemotherapy outcomes were valid for nine patients (n\u2009=\u20099/28, 32.1%). Chemosensitivity assays showed that all 28 patients were sensitive to ifosfamide, whereas 46.4 and 39.2% were sensitive to docetaxel and platinum, respectively. More importantly, patients receiving highly chemosensitive chemotherapy agents had better prognosis and treatment outcomes than those receiving less chemosensitive agents (P\u2009<\u20090.05). In addition, 39 gene mutations were detected in at least five osteosarcoma tumor samples. Analysis of the expression and mutation of drug-metabolism-related genes will aid in the design of effective individualized preoperative chemotherapy regimens for osteosarcoma. Determining the chemosensitivity of individual tumors to chemotherapeutic agents will facilitate the development of better therapeutic approaches. Individualized treatment of osteosarcoma may improve chemotherapy efficacy and the survival rate of osteosarcoma patients. High-throughput genotyping allows mapping of osteosarcoma mutations, and novel gene mutations offered new candidates for diagnosis and therapeutic targeting.",

			"abstract": "FOXO3a and FOXM1 are two forkhead transcription factors with antagonistic roles in cancer and DNA damage response. FOXO3a functions like a typical tumour suppressor, whereas FOXM1 is a potent oncogene aberrantly overexpressed in genotoxic resistant cancers. FOXO3a not only represses FOXM1 expression but also its transcriptional output. Recent research has provided novel insights into a central role for FOXO3a and FOXM1 in DNA damage response. The FOXO3a-FOXM1 axis plays a pivotal role in DNA damage repair and the accompanied cellular response through regulating the expression of genes essential for DNA damage sensing, mediating, signalling and repair as well as for senescence, cell cycle and cell death control. In this manner, the FOXO3a-FOXM1 axis also holds the key to cell fate decision in response to genotoxic therapeutic agents and controls the equilibrium between DNA repair and cell termination by cell death or senescence. As a consequence, inhibition of FOXM1 or reactivation of FOXO3a in cancer cells could enhance the efficacy of DNA damaging cancer therapies by decreasing the rate of DNA repair and cell survival while increasing senescence and cell death. Conceptually, targeting FOXO3a and FOXM1 may represent a promising molecular therapeutic option for improving the efficacy and selectivity of DNA damage agents, particularly in genotoxic agent resistant cancer. In addition, FOXO3a, FOXM1 and their downstream transcriptional targets may also be reliable diagnostic biomarkers for predicting outcome, for selecting therapeutic options, and for monitoring treatments in DNA-damaging agent therapy.",

Drug development strategies target driver mutations, but inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity usually results in emergence of resistance. Here we model intratumoral evolution in the context of a fecundity/survivorship trade-off. Simulations demonstrate that the fitness value of any genetic change is not fixed but dependent on evolutionary triage governed by initial cell properties, current selection forces and prior genotypic/phenotypic trajectories. We demonstrate that spatial variations in molecular properties of tumour cells are the result of changes in environmental selection forces such as blood flow. Simulated therapies targeting fitness-increasing (driver) mutations usually decrease the tumour burden but almost inevitably fail due to population heterogeneity. An alternative strategy targets gene mutations that are never observed. Because up or downregulation of these genes unconditionally reduces cellular fitness, they are eliminated by evolutionary triage but can be exploited for targeted therapy.",

			"abstract": "Next-generation sequencing of human tumours has refined our understanding of the mutational processes operative in cancer initiation and progression, yet major questions remain regarding the factors that induce driver mutations and the processes that shape mutation selection during tumorigenesis. Here we performed whole-exome sequencing on adenomas from three mouse models of non-small-cell lung cancer, which were induced either by exposure to carcinogens (methyl-nitrosourea (MNU) and urethane) or by genetic activation of Kras (Kras(LA2)). Although the MNU-induced tumours carried exactly the same initiating mutation in Kras as seen in the Kras(LA2) model (G12D), MNU tumours had an average of 192 non-synonymous, somatic single-nucleotide variants, compared with only six in tumours from the Kras(LA2) model. By contrast, the Kras(LA2) tumours exhibited a significantly higher level of aneuploidy and copy number alterations compared with the carcinogen-induced tumours, suggesting that carcinogen-induced and genetically engineered models lead to tumour development through different routes. The wild-type allele of Kras has been shown to act as a tumour suppressor in mouse models of non-small-cell lung cancer. We demonstrate that urethane-induced tumours from wild-type mice carry mostly (94%) Kras Q61R mutations, whereas those from Kras heterozygous animals carry mostly (92%) Kras Q61L mutations, indicating a major role for germline Kras status in mutation selection during initiation. The exome-wide mutation spectra in carcinogen-induced tumours overwhelmingly display signatures of the initiating carcinogen, while adenocarcinomas acquire additional C > T mutations at CpG sites. These data provide a basis for understanding results from human tumour genome sequencing, which has identified two broad categories of tumours based on the relative frequency of single-nucleotide variations and copy number alterations, and underline the importance of carcinogen models for understanding the complex mutation spectra seen in human cancers.",

			"abstract": "Genotoxic events have been known as crucial step in the initiation of cancer. To assess the risk of cancer, genotoxicity assays, including comet, micronucleus (MN), chromosomal aberration, bacterial reverse, and sister chromatid exchange assay, can be performed. Compared with in vitro genotoxicity assay, in vivo genotoxicity assay has been used to verify in vitro assay result and definitely provide biological significance for certain organs or cell types. The comet assay can detect DNA strand breaks as markers of genotoxicity. Methods of the in vivo comet assay have been established by Japanese Center for the Validation of Alternative Methods (JaCVAM) validation studies depending on tissue and sample types. The MN can be initiated by segregation error and lagging acentric chromosome fragment. Methods of the in vivo MN assay have been established by Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) test guidelines and many studies. Combining the in vivo comet and MN assay has been regarded as useful methodology for evaluating genetic damage, and it has been used in the assessment of potential carcinogenicity by complementarily presenting two distinct endpoints of the in vivo genotoxicity individual test. Few studies have investigated the quantitative relation between in vivo genotoxicity results and carcinogenicity. Extensive studies emphasizes that positive correlation is detectable. This review summarizes the results of the in vivo comet and MN assays that have investigated the genotoxicity of carcinogens as classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) carcinogenicity database. As a result, these genotoxicity data may provide meaningful information for the assessment of potential carcinogenicity and for implementation in the prevention of cancer.",

We found that overexpression of retinoic acid receptor \u03b1 (RARA) disrupted normal acinar structure and induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The mRNA levels of known EMT-inducing factors, including SLUG, FOXC2, ZEB1, and ZEB2, were significantly increased upon RARA overexpression.

The variant frequency of the mutant clones was compared between pre- and post-treatment samples of nine non-responder patients. RNA-targeted sequencing of 57 genes related to sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiotherapy was performed for the paired samples. Immunohistochemical analyses of p53 expression were also performed on the paired samples from the nine non-responder patients. DNA-sequencing detected frequent mutations of suppressor genes including TP53, APC and FBXW7 in the post-treatment samples of the nine non-responders. The frequency of TP53 mutations showed significant increases after chemoradiotherapy. RNA-targeted sequencing of 29 tumor tissues demonstrated that decreased expression of three genes and increased expression of four genes were detected in the post-treatment samples. Significantly increased expression of TP53 was observed in the post-treatment samples. Immunohistochemical staining for p53 revealed that increased p53 intensity scores were observed after chemoradiotherapy.

			"abstract": "Recent sequencing studies have extensively explored the somatic alterations present in the nuclear genomes of cancers. Although mitochondria control energy metabolism and apoptosis, the origins and impact of cancer-associated mutations in mtDNA are unclear. In this study, we analyzed somatic alterations in mtDNA from 1675 tumors. We identified 1907 somatic substitutions, which exhibited dramatic replicative strand bias, predominantly C > T and A > G on the mitochondrial heavy strand. This strand-asymmetric signature differs from those found in nuclear cancer genomes but matches the inferred germline process shaping primate mtDNA sequence content. A number of mtDNA mutations showed considerable heterogeneity across tumor types. Missense mutations were selectively neutral and often gradually drifted towards homoplasmy over time. In contrast, mutations resulting in protein truncation undergo negative selection and were almost exclusively heteroplasmic. Our findings indicate that the endogenous mutational mechanism has far greater impact than any other external mutagens in mitochondria and is fundamentally linked to mtDNA replication.",

			"abstract": "Advances in sequencing have led to a rapid accumulation of mutations, some of which are associated with diseases. However, to draw mechanistic conclusions, a biochemical understanding of these mutations is necessary. For coding mutations, accurate prediction of significant changes in either the stability of proteins or their affinity to their binding partners is required. Traditional methods have used semi-empirical force fields, while newer methods employ machine learning of sequence and structural features. Here, we show how combining both of these approaches leads to a marked boost in accuracy. We introduce ELASPIC, a novel ensemble machine learning approach that is able to predict stability effects upon mutation in both, domain cores and domain-domain interfaces. We combine semi-empirical energy terms, sequence conservation, and a wide variety of molecular details with a Stochastic Gradient Boosting of Decision Trees (SGB-DT) algorithm. The accuracy of our predictions surpasses existing methods by a considerable margin, achieving correlation coefficients of 0.77 for stability, and 0.75 for affinity predictions. Notably, we integrated homology modeling to enable proteome-wide prediction and show that accurate prediction on modeled structures is possible. Lastly, ELASPIC showed significant differences between various types of disease-associated mutations, as well as between disease and common neutral mutations. Unlike pure sequence-based prediction methods that try to predict phenotypic effects of mutations, our predictions unravel the molecular details governing the protein instability, and help us better understand the molecular causes of diseases.",

			"abstract": "Identification of non-synonymous single nucleotide variations (nsSNVs) has exponentially increased due to advances in Next-Generation Sequencing technologies. The functional impacts of these variations have been difficult to ascertain because the corresponding knowledge about sequence functional sites is quite fragmented. It is clear that mapping of variations to sequence functional features can help us better understand the pathophysiological role of variations. In this study, we investigated the effect of nsSNVs on more than 17 common types of post-translational modification (PTM) sites, active sites and binding sites. Out of 1 705 285 distinct nsSNVs on 259 216 functional sites we identified 38 549 variations that significantly affect 10 major functional sites. Furthermore, we found distinct patterns of site disruptions due to germline and somatic nsSNVs. Pan-cancer analysis across 12 different cancer types led to the identification of 51 genes with 106 nsSNV affected functional sites found in 3 or more cancer types. 13 of the 51 genes overlap with previously identified Significantly Mutated Genes (Nature. 2013 Oct 17;502(7471)). 62 mutations in these 13 genes affecting functional sites such as DNA, ATP binding and various PTM sites occur across several cancers and can be prioritized for additional validation and investigations.",

			"abstract": "Iron is the most abundant metal in the human body and mainly works as a cofactor for proteins such as hemoglobin and various enzymes. No independent life forms on earth can survive without iron. However, excess iron is intimately associated with carcinogenesis by increasing oxidative stress via its catalytic activity to generate hydroxyl radicals. Biomolecules with redox-active sulfhydryl function(s) (thiol compounds) are necessary for the maintenance of mildly reductive cellular environments to counteract oxidative stress, and for the execution of redox reactions for metabolism and detoxification. Involvement of glutathione S-transferase and thioredoxin has long attracted the attention of cancer researchers. Here, I update recent findings on the involvement of iron and thiol compounds during carcinogenesis and in cancer cells. It is now recognized that the cystine/glutamate transporter (antiporter) is intimately associated with ferroptosis, an iron-dependent, non-apoptotic form of cell death, observed in cancer cells, and also with cancer stem cells; the former with transporter blockage but the latter with its stabilization. Excess iron in the presence of oxygen appears the most common known mutagen. Ironically, the persistent activation of antioxidant systems via genetic alterations in Nrf2 and Keap1 also contributes to carcinogenesis. Therefore, it is difficult to conclude the role of iron and thiol compounds as friends or foes, which depends on the quantity/distribution and induction/flexibility, respectively. Avoiding further mutation would be the most helpful strategy for cancer prevention, and myriad of efforts are being made to sort out the weaknesses of cancer cells.",

BRAFV600E remains the only recurrent mutation reported in LCH. In order to evaluate the spectrum of somatic mutations in LCH, whole exome sequencing was performed on matched LCH and normal tissue samples obtained from 41 patients. Lesions from other histiocytic disorders, juvenile xanthogranuloma, Erdheim-Chester disease, and Rosai-Dorfman disease were also evaluated. All of the lesions from histiocytic disorders were characterized by an extremely low overall rate of somatic mutations. Notably, 33% (7/21) of LCH cases with wild-type BRAF and none (0/20) with BRAFV600E harbored somatic mutations in MAP2K1 (6 in-frame deletions and 1 missense mutation) that induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in vitro. Single cases of somatic mutations of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway genes ARAF and ERBB3 were also detected. The ability of MAPK pathway inhibitors to suppress MAPK kinase and ERK phosphorylation in cell culture and primary tumor models was dependent on the specific LCH mutation. The findings of this study support a model in which ERK activation is a universal end point in LCH arising from pathological activation of upstream signaling proteins.",

			"abstract": "Although cancer immunotherapy shows efficacy with adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) and antibody-based immune checkpoint blockade, efficacious therapeutic vaccination of cancer patients with tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) remains largely unmet. Current cancer vaccines utilize nonmutated shared TAAs that may have suboptimal immunogenicity. Experimental evidence underscores the strong immunogenicity of unique TAAs derived from somatically mutated cancer proteins, whose massive characterization has been precluded until recently by technical limitations. The development of cost-effective, high-throughput DNA sequencing approaches makes now possible the rapid identification of all the somatic mutations contained in a cancer cell genome. This method, combined with robust bioinformatics platforms for T cell epitope prediction and established reverse immunology approaches, provides us with an integrated strategy to identify patient-specific unique TAAs in a relatively short time, compatible with their potential use in the clinic. Hence, it is now for the first time possible to quantitatively define the patient's unique tumor antigenome and exploit it for vaccination, possibly in combination with ACT and/or immune checkpoint blockade to further increase immunotherapy efficacy.",

Approaches have been devised to quantify, for example, the tendency of a set of genes to be mutated in a 'mutually exclusive' manner. The significance of the proposed metrics is usually evaluated by computing P-values under appropriate null models. To this end, a Monte Carlo method (the switching-algorithm) is used to sample simulated datasets under a null model that preserves patient- and gene-wise mutation rates. In this method, a genomic dataset is represented as a bipartite network, to which Markov chain updates (switching-steps) are applied. These steps modify the network topology, and a minimal number of them must be executed to draw simulated datasets independently under the null model. This number has previously been deducted empirically to be a linear function of the total number of variants, making this process computationally expensive.",

			"abstract": "Glioblastoma is the most common intracranial malignancy and constitutes about 50 % of all gliomas. Both inter-tumor and intra-tumor histological heterogeneity had been recognized by the early 1980-ies. Recent works using novel molecular platforms provided molecular definitions of these tumors. Based on comprehensive genomic sequence analyses, The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network (TCGA) cataloged somatic mutations and recurrent copy number alterations in glioblastoma. Robust transcriptome and epigenome studies also revealed inter-tumor heterogeneity. Integration and cluster analyses of multi-dimensional genomic data lead to a new classification of glioblastoma tumors into subtypes with distinct biological features and clinical correlates. However, multiple observations also revealed tumor area-specific patterns of genomic imbalance. In addition, genetic alterations have been identified that were common to all areas analyzed and other alterations that were area specific. Analyses of intra-tumor transcriptome variations revealed that in more than half of the examined cases, fragments from the same tumor mass could be classified into at least two different glioblastoma molecular subgroups. Intra-tumor heterogeneity of molecular genetic profiles in glioblastoma may explain the difficulties encountered in the validation of oncologic biomarkers, and contribute to a biased selection of patients for single target therapies, treatment failure or drug resistance. In this paper, we summarize the currently available literature concerning inter- and intra-tumor molecular heterogeneity of glioblastomas, and call attention to the importance of this topic in relation to the growing efforts in routine molecular diagnostics and personalized therapy.",

A post-translationally modified form of annexin A1 (AnnA1) is selectively concentrated in human and rodent tumor caveolae. To follow trafficking, we generated a specific AnnA1 antibody that targets caveolae in the tumor endothelium. Intravital microscopy of caveolae-immunotargeted fluorophores even at low intravenous doses showed rapid and robust pumping across the endothelium to enter mammary, prostate and lung tumors. Within 1 h, the fluorescence signal concentrated throughout tumors to exceed the peak levels in blood. This transvascular pumping required the expression of caveolin 1 and annexin A1. Tumor uptake with other antibodies were >100-fold less. This proteomic imaging strategy reveals a unique target, antibody and caveolae pumping system for solid tumor penetration.",

			"abstract": "Pediatric tumors are relatively infrequent, but are often associated with significant lethality and lifelong morbidity. A major goal of pediatric cancer research has been to identify key drivers of tumorigenesis to eventually develop targeted therapies to enhance cure rate and minimize acute and long-term toxic effects. Here, we used genomic approaches to identify biomarkers and candidate drivers for fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC), a very rare subtype of pediatric liver cancer for which limited therapeutic options exist. In-depth genomic analyses of one tumor followed by immunohistochemistry validation on seven other tumors showed expression of neuroendocrine markers in FL-HCC. DNA and RNA sequencing data further showed that common cancer pathways are not visibly altered in FL-HCC but identified two novel structural variants, both resulting in fusion transcripts. The first, a 400 kb deletion, results in a DNAJB1-PRKCA fusion transcript, which leads to increased cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity in the index tumor case and other FL-HCC cases compared with normal liver. This PKA fusion protein is oncogenic in HCC cells. The second gene fusion event, a translocation between the CLPTM1L and GLIS3 genes, generates a transcript whose product also promotes cancer phenotypes in HCC cell lines. These experiments further highlight the tumorigenic role of gene fusions in the etiology of pediatric solid tumors and identify both candidate biomarkers and possible therapeutic targets for this lethal pediatric disease.",

Two relatively easy-to-research areas are the search for successful cross-link breakers and an effective lysosomal degradation therapy. A more complex and speculative strategy is whole-body interdiction of lengthening of telomeres (WILT). Highlighting these as examples, I argue that it is unlikely that such rejuvenation biotechnologies will be used meaningfully by the general public. The discussion assumes that although such therapies may in theory one day be developed in the laboratory, and even possibly be formulated as physical clinical therapies, these will be unusable in practical terms when applied upon humans at large.

Moreover, the constant discovery of new non-coding RNA species suggests that the study of their complex functions is still in its very early stages. This variegated class of RNA species encompasses the well-known microRNAs (miRNAs) and the most recently acknowledged long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Interestingly, in the last couple of years, a few studies have shown that some lncRNAs can act as miRNA sponges, i.e. as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), able to reduce the amount of miRNAs available to target messenger RNAs (mRNAs).",

			"abstract": "Mutation is associated with developmental and hereditary disorders, aging, and cancer. While we understand some mutational processes operative in human disease, most remain mysterious. We used Caenorhabditis elegans whole-genome sequencing to model mutational signatures, analyzing 183 worm populations across 17 DNA repair-deficient backgrounds propagated for 20 generations or exposed to carcinogens. The baseline mutation rate in C. elegans was approximately one per genome per generation, not overtly altered across several DNA repair deficiencies over 20 generations. Telomere erosion led to complex chromosomal rearrangements initiated by breakage-fusion-bridge cycles and completed by simultaneously acquired, localized clusters of breakpoints. Aflatoxin B1 induced substitutions of guanines in a GpC context, as observed in aflatoxin-induced liver cancers. Mutational burden increased with impaired nucleotide excision repair. Cisplatin and mechlorethamine, DNA crosslinking agents, caused dose- and genotype-dependent signatures among indels, substitutions, and rearrangements. Strikingly, both agents induced clustered rearrangements resembling \"chromoanasynthesis,\" a replication-based mutational signature seen in constitutional genomic disorders, suggesting that interstrand crosslinks may play a pathogenic role in such events. Cisplatin mutagenicity was most pronounced in xpf-1 mutants, suggesting that this gene critically protects cells against platinum chemotherapy. Thus, experimental model systems combined with genome sequencing can recapture and mechanistically explain mutational signatures associated with human disease.",

However, the etiological background of chondrosarcomagenesis remains largely unknown, along with details on molecular alterations and potential therapeutic targets. Massively parallel paired-end sequencing of whole genomes of 10 primary chondrosarcomas revealed that the process of accumulation of somatic mutations is homogeneous irrespective of the pathological subtype or the presence of IDH1 mutations, is unique among a range of cancer types, and shares significant commonalities with that of prostate cancer. Clusters of structural alterations localized within a single chromosome were observed in four cases. Combined with targeted resequencing of additional cartilaginous tumor cohorts, we identified somatic alterations of the COL2A1 gene, which encodes an essential extracellular matrix protein in chondroskeletal development, in 19.3% of chondrosarcoma and 31.7% of enchondroma cases. Epigenetic regulators (IDH1 and YEATS2) and an activin/BMP signal component (ACVR2A) were recurrently altered. Furthermore, a novel FN1-ACVR2A fusion transcript was observed in both chondrosarcoma and osteochondromatosis cases. With the characteristic accumulative process of somatic changes as a background, molecular defects in chondrogenesis and aberrant epigenetic control are primarily causative of both benign and malignant cartilaginous tumors.",

The authors new method adopts a novel statistical model to explicitly quantify the SNP signals, and therefore infers the genomic aberrations, including copy number alteration and loss of heterozygosity. Examination on the dilution series dataset shows that this method can correctly identify the genomic aberrations even with the existence of severe normal cell contamination in tumour sample. Furthermore, with the results of the aberration identification obtained from multiple tumour samples, a permutation-based approach is proposed for identifying the statistically significant driver aberrations, which are further incorporated with the known signalling pathways for pathway enrichment analysis. By applying the approach to 286 hepatocellular tumour samples, they successfully uncover numerous driver aberration regions across the cancer genome, for example, chromosomes 4p and 5q, which harbour many known hepatocellular cancer related genes such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and ectodermal-neural cortex (ENC1). In addition, they identify nine disrupted pathways that are highly enriched by the driver aberrations, including the systemic lupus erythematosus pathway, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signalling pathway and so on. These results support the feasibility and the utility of the proposed method on the characterisation of the cancer genome and the downstream analysis of the driver aberrations and the disrupted signalling pathways.",

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the acquisition and maintenance of CSC properties in cancer cells because of their rarity in clinical samples. We herein induced CSC properties in cancer cells using defined factors. We retrovirally introduced a set of defined factors (OCT3/4, SOX2 and KLF4) into human colon cancer cells, followed by culture with conventional serum-containing medium, not human embryonic stem cell medium. We then evaluated the CSC properties in the cells. The colon cancer cells transduced with the three factors showed significantly enhanced CSC properties in terms of the marker gene expression, sphere formation, chemoresistance and tumorigenicity. We designated the cells with CSC properties induced by the factors, a subset of the transduced cells, as induced CSCs (iCSCs). Moreover, we established a novel technology to isolate and collect the iCSCs based on the differences in the degree of the dye-effluxing activity enhancement. The xenografts derived from our iCSCs were not teratomas. Notably, in contrast to the tumors from the parental cancer cells, the iCSC-based tumors mimicked actual human colon cancer tissues in terms of their immunohistological findings, which showed colonic lineage differentiation. In addition, we confirmed that the phenotypes of our iCSCs were reproducible in serial transplantation experiments. By introducing defined factors, we generated iCSCs with lineage specificity directly from cancer cells, not via an induced pluripotent stem cell state. The novel method enables us to obtain abundant materials of CSCs that not only have enhanced tumorigenicity, but also the ability to differentiate to recapitulate a specific type of cancer tissues. Our method can be of great value to fully understand CSCs and develop new therapies targeting CSCs.",

With the advent of whole-genome sequencing, researchers are identifying an increasing array of these signatures.

DNA whole exome sequencing (DNA-WES) is currently the most popular technology; however, this yields low sensitivity in low purity tumors. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) covers the expressed exome with depth proportional to expression. We hypothesized that integrating DNA-WES and RNA-seq would enable superior mutation detection versus DNA-WES alone. We developed a first-of-its-kind method, called UNCeqR, that detects somatic mutations by integrating patient-matched RNA-seq and DNA-WES. In simulation, the integrated DNA and RNA model outperformed the DNA-WES only model. Validation by patient-matched whole genome sequencing demonstrated superior performance of the integrated model over DNA-WES only models, including a published method and published mutation profiles. Genome-wide mutational analysis of breast and lung cancer cohorts (n = 871) revealed remarkable tumor genomics properties. Low purity tumors experienced the largest gains in mutation detection by integrating RNA-seq and DNA-WES. RNA provided greater mutation signal than DNA in expressed mutations. Compared to earlier studies on this cohort, UNCeqR increased mutation rates of driver and therapeutically targeted genes (e.g. PIK3CA, ERBB2 and FGFR2). In summary, integrating RNA-seq with DNA-WES increases mutation detection performance, especially for low purity tumors.",

			"abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) is an evolutionarily conserved process that plays a pivotal role in the equilibrium between genetic stability and diversity. HR is commonly considered to be error-free, but several studies have shown that HR can be error-prone. Here, we discuss the actual accuracy of HR. First, we present the product of genetic exchanges (gene conversion, GC, and crossing over, CO) and the mechanisms of HR during double strand break repair and replication restart. We discuss the intrinsic capacities of HR to generate genome rearrangements by GC or CO, either during DSB repair or replication restart. During this process, abortive HR intermediates generate genetic instability and cell toxicity. In addition to genome rearrangements, HR also primes error-prone DNA synthesis and favors mutagenesis on single stranded DNA, a key DNA intermediate during the HR process. The fact that cells have developed several mechanisms protecting against HR excess emphasize its potential risks. Consistent with this duality, several pro-oncogenic situations have been consistently associated with either decreased or increased HR levels. Nevertheless, this versatility also has advantages that we outline here. We conclude that HR is a double-edged sword, which on one hand controls the equilibrium between genome stability and diversity but, on the other hand, can jeopardize the maintenance of genomic integrity. Therefore, whether non-homologous end joining (which, in contrast with HR, is not intrinsically mutagenic) or HR is the more mutagenic process is a question that should be re-evaluated. Both processes can be \"Dr. Jekyll\" in maintaining genome stability/variability and \"Mr. Hyde\" in jeopardizing genome integrity.",

Cancer is primarily a genetic disease in which genetic factors and environmental stimuli interact to cause genetic and epigenetic aberrations in human cells. Mutations in the germline act as either high-penetrance alleles that strongly increase the risk of cancer development, or as low-penetrance alleles that mildly change an individual's susceptibility to cancer. Somatic mutations, resulting from either DNA damage induced by exposure to environmental mutagens or from spontaneous errors in DNA replication or repair are involved in the development or progression of the cancer. Induced or spontaneous changes in the epigenome may also drive carcinogenesis. Advances in next-generation sequencing technology provide us opportunities to accurately, economically, and rapidly identify genetic variants, somatic mutations, gene expression profiles, and epigenetic alterations with single-base resolution. Whole genome sequencing, whole exome sequencing, and RNA sequencing of paired cancer and adjacent normal tissue present a comprehensive picture of the cancer genome.

In addition to novel germline polymorphisms, we find 810 somatic retrotransposon insertions primarily in lung squamous, head and neck, colorectal, and endometrial carcinomas. Many somatic retrotransposon insertions occur in known cancer genes. We find that high somatic retrotransposition rates in tumors are associated with high rates of genomic rearrangement and somatic mutation. Finally, we developed TranspoSeq-Exome to interrogate an additional 767 tumor samples with hybrid-capture exome data and discovered 35 novel somatic retrotransposon insertions into exonic regions, including an insertion into an exon of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene. The results of this large-scale, comprehensive analysis of retrotransposon movement across tumor types suggest that somatic retrotransposon insertions may represent an important class of structural variation in cancer.",

			"abstract": "The complexity of signalling pathways was boosted at the origin of the vertebrates, when two rounds of whole genome duplication (2R-WGD) occurred. Those genes and proteins that have survived from the 2R-WGD-termed 2R-ohnologues-belong to families of two to four members, and are enriched in signalling components relevant to cancer. Here, we find that while only approximately 30% of human transcript-coding genes are 2R-ohnologues, they carry 42-60% of the gene mutations in 30 different cancer types. Across a subset of cancer datasets, including melanoma, breast, lung adenocarcinoma, liver and medulloblastoma, we identified 673 2R-ohnologue families in which one gene carries mutations at multiple positions, while sister genes in the same family are relatively mutation free. Strikingly, in 315 of the 322 2R-ohnologue families displaying such a skew in multiple cancers, the same gene carries the heaviest mutation load in each cancer, and usually the second-ranked gene is also the same in each cancer. Our findings inspire the hypothesis that in certain cancers, heterogeneous combinations of genetic changes impair parts of the 2R-WGD signalling networks and force information flow through a limited set of oncogenic pathways in which specific non-mutated 2R-ohnologues serve as effectors. The non-mutated 2R-ohnologues are therefore potential therapeutic targets. These include proteins linked to growth factor signalling, neurotransmission and ion channels.",

			"abstract": "Cancer is a genetic disease that develops through a series of somatic mutations, a subset of which drive cancer progression. Although cancer genome sequencing studies are beginning to reveal the mutational patterns of genes in various cancers, identifying the small subset of \"causative\" mutations from the large subset of \"non-causative\" mutations, which accumulate as a consequence of the disease, is a challenge. In this article, we present an effective machine learning approach for identifying cancer-associated mutations in human protein kinases, a class of signaling proteins known to be frequently mutated in human cancers. We evaluate the performance of 11 well known supervised learners and show that a multiple-classifier approach, which combines the performances of individual learners, significantly improves the classification of known cancer-associated mutations. We introduce several novel features related specifically to structural and functional characteristics of protein kinases and find that the level of conservation of the mutated residue at specific evolutionary depths is an important predictor of oncogenic effect. We consolidate the novel features and the multiple-classifier approach to prioritize and experimentally test a set of rare unconfirmed mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR). Our studies identify T725M and L861R as rare cancer-associated mutations inasmuch as these mutations increase EGFR activity in the absence of the activating EGF ligand in cell-based assays.",

			"abstract": "Despite intense research efforts that have provided enormous insight, cancer continues to be a poorly understood disease. There has been much debate over whether the cancerous state can be said to originate in a single cell or whether it is a reflection of aberrant behaviour on the part of a 'society of cells'. This article presents, in the form of a debate conducted among the authors, three views of how the problem might be addressed. We do not claim that the views exhaust all possibilities. These views are (a) the tissue organization field theory (TOFT) that is based on a breakdown of tissue organization involving many cells from different embryological layers, (b) the cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis that focuses on genetic and epigenetic changes that take place within single cells, and (c) the proposition that rewiring of the cell's protein interaction networks mediated by intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) drives the tumorigenic process. The views are based on different philosophical approaches. In detail, they differ on some points and agree on others. It is left to the reader to decide whether one approach to understanding cancer appears more promising than the other.",

			"abstract": "The somatic mutations in a cancer genome are the aggregate outcome of one or more mutational processes operative through the lifetime of the individual with cancer. Each mutational process leaves a characteristic mutational signature determined by the mechanisms of DNA damage and repair that constitute it. A role was recently proposed for the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases in generating particular genome-wide mutational signatures and a signature of localized hypermutation called kataegis. A germline copy number polymorphism involving APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B, which effectively deletes APOBEC3B, has been associated with modestly increased risk of breast cancer. Here we show that breast cancers in carriers of the deletion show more mutations of the putative APOBEC-dependent genome-wide signatures than cancers in non-carriers. The results suggest that the APOBEC3A-APOBEC3B germline deletion allele confers cancer susceptibility through increased activity of APOBEC-dependent mutational processes, although the mechanism by which this increase in activity occurs remains unknown.",

Germline retrotransposition can cause processed pseudogenes, but whether this occurs somatically has not been evaluated. Here we screen sequencing data from 660 cancer samples for somatically acquired pseudogenes. We find 42 events in 17 samples, especially non-small cell lung cancer (5/27) and colorectal cancer (2/11). Genomic features mirror those of germline LINE element retrotranspositions, with frequent target-site duplications (67%), consensus TTTTAA sites at insertion points, inverted rearrangements (21%), 5' truncation (74%) and polyA tails (88%). Transcriptional consequences include expression of pseudogenes from UTRs or introns of target genes. In addition, a somatic pseudogene that integrated into the promoter and first exon of the tumour suppressor gene, MGA, abrogated expression from that allele. Thus, formation of processed pseudogenes represents a new class of mutation occurring during cancer development, with potentially diverse functional consequences depending on genomic context.",

			"abstract": "Somatic mutations play a major role in tumour initiation and progression. The mutation status of a tumour may predict prognosis and guide targeted therapies. The majority of techniques to study oncogenic mutations require high quality and quantity DNA or are analytically challenging. Mass-spectrometry based mutation analysis however is a relatively simple and high-throughput method suitable for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour material. Targeted gene panels using this technique have been developed for several types of cancer. These current cancer hotspot panels are not focussed on the genes that are most relevant in gynaecological cancers. In this study, we report the design and validation of a novel, mass-spectrometry based panel specifically for gynaecological malignancies and present the frequencies of detected mutations. Using frequency data from the online Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer, we selected 171 somatic hotspot mutations in the 13 most important genes for gynaecological cancers, being BRAF, CDKN2A, CTNNB1, FBXW7, FGFR2, FGFR3, FOXL2, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA, PPP2R1A and PTEN. A total of 546 tumours (205 cervical, 227 endometrial, 89 ovarian, and 25 vulvar carcinomas) were used to test and validate our panel, and to study the prevalence and spectrum of somatic mutations in these types of cancer. The results were validated by testing duplicate samples and by allele-specific qPCR. The panel presented here using mass-spectrometry shows to be reproducible and high-throughput, and is usefull in FFPE material of low quality and quantity. It provides new possibilities for studying large numbers of gynaecological tumour samples in daily practice, and could be useful in guided therapy selection.",

			"abstract": "Changes in gene dosage are a major driver of cancer, known to be caused by a finite, but increasingly well annotated, repertoire of mutational mechanisms. This can potentially generate correlated copy-number alterations across hundreds of linked genes, as exemplified by the 2% of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) with recurrent amplification of megabase regions of chromosome 21 (iAMP21). We used genomic, cytogenetic and transcriptional analysis, coupled with novel bioinformatic approaches, to reconstruct the evolution of iAMP21 ALL. Here we show that individuals born with the rare constitutional Robertsonian translocation between chromosomes 15 and 21, rob(15;21)(q10;q10)c, have approximately 2,700-fold increased risk of developing iAMP21 ALL compared to the general population. In such cases, amplification is initiated by a chromothripsis event involving both sister chromatids of the Robertsonian chromosome, a novel mechanism for cancer predisposition. In sporadic iAMP21, breakage-fusion-bridge cycles are typically the initiating event, often followed by chromothripsis. In both sporadic and rob(15;21)c-associated iAMP21, the final stages frequently involve duplications of the entire abnormal chromosome. The end-product is a derivative of chromosome 21 or the rob(15;21)c chromosome with gene dosage optimized for leukaemic potential, showing constrained copy-number levels over multiple linked genes. Thus, dicentric chromosomes may be an important precipitant of chromothripsis, as we show rob(15;21)c to be constitutionally dicentric and breakage-fusion-bridge cycles generate dicentric chromosomes somatically. Furthermore, our data illustrate that several cancer-specific mutational processes, applied sequentially, can coordinate to fashion copy-number profiles over large genomic scales, incrementally refining the fitness benefits of aggregated gene dosage changes.",

			"abstract": "Epigenetic alterations are associated with all aspects of cancer, from tumor initiation to cancer progression and metastasis. It is now well understood that both losses and gains of DNA methylation as well as altered chromatin organization contribute significantly to cancer-associated phenotypes. More recently, new sequencing technologies have allowed the identification of driver mutations in epigenetic regulators, providing a mechanistic link between the cancer epigenome and genetic alterations. Oncogenic activating mutations are now known to occur in a number of epigenetic modifiers (i.e. IDH1/2, EZH2, DNMT3A), pinpointing epigenetic pathways that are involved in tumorigenesis. Similarly, investigations into the role of inactivating mutations in chromatin modifiers (i.e. KDM6A, CREBBP/EP300, SMARCB1) implicate many of these genes as tumor suppressors. Intriguingly, a number of neoplasms are defined by a plethora of mutations in epigenetic regulators, including renal, bladder, and adenoid cystic carcinomas. Particularly striking is the discovery of frequent histone H3.3 mutations in pediatric glioma, a particularly aggressive neoplasm that has long remained poorly understood. Cancer epigenetics is a relatively new, promising frontier with much potential for improving cancer outcomes. Already, therapies such as 5-azacytidine and decitabine have proven that targeting epigenetic alterations in cancer can lead to tangible benefits. Understanding how genetic alterations give rise to the cancer epigenome will offer new possibilities for developing better prognostic and therapeutic strategies.",

The second is the description of the systems-level properties of 64 human microRNAs that are causally involved in cancer progression (oncomiRs).

The second 'experiment' has been the use of large-scale biological models such as cancer cell lines to correlate mutations in cancer genes with drug sensitivity, such that one could begin to develop rationale clinical trials to begin to test these hypotheses.

A commonly occurring application is the identification of somatic mutations occurring in tumor tissue samples driving a single cell to expand clonally.

Thus obtaining precise estimates of the frequency of abnormal alleles at various stages of the disease is paramount to understanding the processes driving it.

They are characterized with different behaviors in clinical and molecular profiles, such as survival rates, gene signature and copy number aberrations (CNAs). While cancer is generally believed to have been caused by genetic aberrations, the number of such events is tremendous in the cancer tissue and only a small subset of them may be tumorigenic. On the other hand, gene expression signature of a subtype represents residuals of the subtype-specific cancer mechanisms. Using high-throughput data to link these factors to define subtype boundaries and identify subtype-specific drivers, is a promising yet largely unexplored topic.",

To identify novel splicing variants from exome sequencing data, we developed a bioinformatics splice-site prediction procedure to analyze next-generation sequencing (NGS) data (SpliceFinder). SpliceFinder integrates two functional annotation tools for NGS, ANNOVAR and MutationTaster and two canonical splice site prediction programs for single mutation analysis, SSPNN and NetGene2. By SpliceFinder, we identified somatic mutations affecting RNA splicing in a colon cancer sample, in eight atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML), and eight CML patients. A novel homozygous splicing mutation was found in APC (NM_000038.4:c.1312+5G>A) and six heterozygous in GNAQ (NM_002072.2:c.735+1C>T), ABCC 3 (NM_003786.3:c.1783-1G>A), KLHDC 1 (NM_172193.1:c.568-2A>G), HOOK 1 (NM_015888.4:c.1662-1G>A), SMAD 9 (NM_001127217.2:c.1004-1C>T), and DNAH 9 (NM_001372.3:c.10242+5G>A). Integrating whole-exome and RNA sequencing in aCML and CML, we assessed the phenotypic effect of mutations on mRNA splicing for GNAQ, ABCC 3, HOOK 1. In ABCC 3 and HOOK 1, RNA-Seq showed the presence of aberrant transcripts with activation of a cryptic splice site or intron retention, validated by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the case of HOOK 1. In GNAQ, RNA-Seq showed 22% of wild-type transcript and 78% of mRNA skipping exon 5, resulting in a 4-6 frameshift fusion confirmed by RT-PCR. The pipeline can be useful to identify intronic variants affecting RNA sequence by complementing conventional exome analysis.",

However, the complicated nature of tumor usually hampers the dissection of the SNP arrays. In this study, we describe a bioinformatic tool, named GIANT, for genome-wide identification of somatic aberrations from paired normal-tumor samples measured with SNP arrays. By efficiently incorporating genotype information of matched normal sample, it accurately detects different types of aberrations in cancer genome, even for aneuploid tumor samples with severe normal cell contamination. Furthermore, it allows for discovery of recurrent aberrations with critical biological properties in tumorigenesis by using statistical significance test. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method on various datasets including tumor replicate pairs, simulated SNP arrays and dilution series of normal-cancer cell lines. Results show that GIANT has the potential to detect the genomic aberration even when the cancer cell proportion is as low as 5\u223c10%. Application on a large number of paired tumor samples delivers a genome-wide profile of the statistical significance of the various aberrations, including amplification, deletion and LOH. We believe that GIANT represents a powerful bioinformatic tool for interpreting the complex genomic aberration, and thus assisting both academic study and the clinical treatment of cancer.",

Our ability to identify the mechanisms involved in B-cell lymphoma pathogenesis has been boosted recently through the use of Next Generation Sequencing techniques in the analysis of human cancer. This work summarizes the recent findings in the molecular pathogenesis of B-cell neoplasms with special focus on those clinically relevant somatic mutations with the potential to be explored as candidates for the development of new targeted therapies. Our work includes a comparison between the mutational indexes and ranges observed in B-cell lymphomas and also with other solid tumors and describes the most striking mutational data for the major B-cell neoplasms.

While much progress has been made to elucidate the aetiology of disease processes in cancer, the contributions to disease that many individual mutations make remain to be characterised and their downstream consequences on cancer phenotypes remain to be understood. Missense mutations commonly occur in cancers and their consequences remain challenging to predict. However, this knowledge is becoming more vital, for both assessing disease progression and for stratifying drug treatment regimes. Coupled with structural data, comprehensive genomic databases of mutations such as the 1000 Genomes project and COSMIC give an opportunity to investigate general principles of how cancer mutations disrupt proteins and their interactions at the molecular and network level. We describe a comprehensive comparison of cancer and neutral missense mutations; by combining features derived from structural and interface properties we have developed a carcinogenicity predictor, InCa (Index of Carcinogenicity). Upon comparison with other methods, we observe that InCa can predict mutations that might not be detected by other methods. We also discuss general limitations shared by all predictors that attempt to predict driver mutations and discuss how this could impact high-throughput predictions.

			"abstract": "High-throughput short-read sequencing of exomes and whole cancer genomes in multiple human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cohorts confirmed previously identified frequently mutated somatic genes, such as TP53, CTNNB1 and AXIN1, and identified several novel genes with moderate mutation frequencies, including ARID1A, ARID2, MLL, MLL2, MLL3, MLL4, IRF2, ATM, CDKN2A, FGF19, PIK3CA, RPS6KA3, JAK1, KEAP1, NFE2L2, C16orf62, LEPR, RAC2, and IL6ST. Functional classification of these mutated genes suggested that alterations in pathways participating in chromatin remodeling, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, JAK/STAT signaling, and oxidative stress play critical roles in HCC tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, because there are few druggable genes used in HCC therapy, the identification of new therapeutic targets through integrated genomic approaches remains an important task. Because a large amount of HCC genomic data genotyped by high density single nucleotide polymorphism arrays is deposited in the public domain, copy number alteration (CNA) analyses of these arrays is a cost-effective way to reveal target genes through profiling of recurrent and overlapping amplicons, homozygous deletions and potentially unbalanced chromosomal translocations accumulated during HCC progression. Moreover, integration of CNAs with other high-throughput genomic data, such as aberrantly coding transcriptomes and non-coding gene expression in human HCC tissues and rodent HCC models, provides lines of evidence that can be used to facilitate the identification of novel HCC target genes with the potential of improving the survival of HCC patients.",

			"abstract": "A major challenge in cancer genomics is uncovering genes with an active role in tumorigenesis from a potentially large pool of mutated genes across patient samples. Here we focus on the interactions that proteins make with nucleic acids, small molecules, ions and peptides, and show that residues within proteins that are involved in these interactions are more frequently affected by mutations observed in large-scale cancer genomic data than are other residues. We leverage this observation to predict genes that play a functionally important role in cancers by introducing a computational pipeline (http://canbind.princeton.edu) for mapping large-scale cancer exome data across patients onto protein structures, and automatically extracting proteins with an enriched number of mutations affecting their nucleic acid, small molecule, ion or peptide binding sites. Using this computational approach, we show that many previously known genes implicated in cancers are enriched in mutations within the binding sites of their encoded proteins. By focusing on functionally relevant portions of proteins--specifically those known to be involved in molecular interactions--our approach is particularly well suited to detect infrequent mutations that may nonetheless be important in cancer, and should aid in expanding our functional understanding of the genomic landscape of cancer.",

Suppression of TRAF2 in cancer cells harboring TRAF2 copy number gain inhibits proliferation, NF-\u03baB activation, anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenesis. Cancer cells that are dependent on TRAF2 also require NF-\u03baB for survival. The phosphorylation of TRAF2 at serine 11 is essential for the survival of cancer cells harboring TRAF2 amplification.

Among these mutated genes, driver genes are defined as being causally linked to oncogenesis, while passenger genes are thought to be irrelevant for cancer development. With increasing numbers of large-scale genomic datasets available, integrating these genomic data to identify driver genes from aberration regions of cancer genomes becomes an important goal of cancer genome analysis and investigations into mechanisms responsible for cancer development. A computational method, MAXDRIVER, is proposed here to identify potential driver genes on the basis of copy number aberration (CNA) regions of cancer genomes, by integrating publicly available human genomic data. MAXDRIVER employs several optimization strategies to construct a heterogeneous network, by means of combining a fused gene functional similarity network, gene-disease associations and a disease phenotypic similarity network. MAXDRIVER was validated to effectively recall known associations among genes and cancers. Previously identified as well as novel driver genes were detected by scanning CNAs of breast cancer, melanoma and liver carcinoma. Three predicted driver genes (CDKN2A, AKT1, RNF139) were found common in these three cancers by comparative analysis.",

Soluble carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have shown promising applications in the diagnosis and therapy of cancer, however, the potential relationship between cancer-prone individuals and response to CNT exposure as a prerequisite for development of personalized nanomedicine, is still poorly understood. Here we report that intravenous injections of multi-walled carbon nanotubes into p53 (a well-known cancer-susceptible gene) heterozygous pregnant mice can induce p53- dependent responses in fetal development. Larger sized multi-walled carbon nanotubes moved across the blood-placenta barrier (BPB), restricted the development of fetuses, and induced brain deformity, whereas single-walled and smaller sized multi-walled carbon nanotubes showed no or less fetotoxicity. A molecular mechanism study found that multi-walled carbon nanotubes directly triggered p53-dependent apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage. Based on the molecular mechanism, we also incorporated N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an FDA approved antioxidant, to prevent CNTs induced nuclear DNA damage and reduce brain development abnormalities. Our findings suggest that CNTs might have genetic background-dependent toxic effect on the normal development of the embryo, and provide new insights into protection against nanoparticle-induced toxicity in potential clinical applications.",

The genomic instability observed in tumor cells and all other recognized hallmarks of cancer are considered downstream epiphenomena of the initial disturbance of cellular energy metabolism. The disturbances in tumor cell energy metabolism can be linked to abnormalities in the structure and function of the mitochondria. When viewed as a mitochondrial metabolic disease, the evolutionary theory of Lamarck can better explain cancer progression than can the evolutionary theory of Darwin. Cancer growth and progression can be managed following a whole body transition from fermentable metabolites, primarily glucose and glutamine, to respiratory metabolites, primarily ketone bodies. As each individual is a unique metabolic entity, personalization of metabolic therapy as a broad-based cancer treatment strategy will require fine-tuning to match the therapy to an individual's unique physiology.",

How specific alleles influence the nature and position of accumulated mutations in a genomic context is largely unknown. Understanding the impact of genome-destabilizing alleles is particularly relevant to cancer genomes where biased mutational signatures are identifiable. We first created a more complete picture of cellular pathways that impact mutation rate using a primary screen to identify essential Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene mutations that cause mutator phenotypes. Drawing primarily on new alleles identified in this resource, we measure the impact of diverse mutator alleles on mutation patterns directly by whole-genome sequencing of 68 mutation-accumulation strains derived from wild-type and 11 parental mutator genotypes. The accumulated mutations differ across mutator strains, displaying base-substitution biases, allele-specific mutation hotspots, and break-associated mutation clustering. For example, in mutants of POL\u03b1 and the Cdc13-Stn1-Ten1 complex, we find a distinct subtelomeric bias for mutations that we show is independent of the target sequence. Together our data suggest that specific genome-instability mutations are sufficient to drive discrete mutational signatures, some of which share properties with mutation patterns seen in tumors. Thus, in a population of cells, genome-instability mutations could influence clonal evolution by establishing discrete mutational trajectories for genomes.",

SP cells may be responsible for the maintenance and propagation of tumors and the proportion of SP cells may be a predictor of patient outcome. Several of these markers used in cell sorting have emerged as prognostic markers of disease progression though it is seen that the development of new CSC-targeted strategies is often hindered by poor understanding of their regulatory networks and functions.

We provide two points of view, 'Cancer' and 'Gene', to help researchers to visualize the relationships between cancers and driver genes/mutations. The 'Cancer' section summarizes the calculated results of driver genes by eight computational methods for a specific cancer type/dataset and provides three levels of biological interpretation for realization of the relationships between driver genes. The 'Gene' section is designed to visualize the mutation information of a driver gene in five different aspects. Moreover, a 'Meta-Analysis' function is provided so researchers may identify driver genes in customer-defined samples. The novel driver genes/mutations identified hold potential for both basic research and biotech applications.",

			"abstract": "LINE-1 (Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements) and HERVs (Human Endogenous Retroviruses) are two families of autonomously replicating retrotransposons that together account for about 28% of the human genome. Genes harbored within LINE-1 and HERV retrotransposons, particularly those encoding the reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme, are generally expressed at low levels in differentiated cells, but their expression is upregulated in transformed cells and embryonic tissues. Here we discuss a recently discovered RT-dependent mechanism that operates in tumorigenesis and reversibly modulates phenotypic and functional variations associated with tumor progression. Downregulation of active LINE-1 elements drastically reduces the tumorigenic potential of cancer cells, paralleled by reduced proliferation and increased differentiation. Pharmacological RT inhibitors (e.g., nevirapine and efavirenz) exert similar effects on tumorigenic cell lines, both in culture and in animal models. The HERV-K family play a distinct complementary role in stress-dependent transition of melanoma cells from an adherent, non-aggressive, to a non-adherent, highly malignant, growth phenotype. In synthesis, the retrotransposon-encoded RT is increasingly emerging as a key regulator of tumor progression and a promising target in a novel anti-cancer therapy.",

In this study, destruxin B was extracted and purified by ion-exchange chromatography, silica gel chromatography, and semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography. The potential anticancer effects and molecular mechanisms of destruxin B in human nonsmall cell lung cancer cell lines were characterized. Our results showed that destruxin B induced apoptotic cell death in A549 cells. This event was accompanied by the activation of caspase-2, -3, and -9. Moreover, destruxin B increased the expression level of proapoptotic molecule, PUMA, while decreased antiapoptotic molecule Mcl-1. Additionally, the translocation of Bax from cytosol to mitochondrial membrane was observed upon destruxin B treatment. Knockdown of Bax by shRNA effectively attenuated destruxin-B-triggered apoptosis in A549 cells. Interestingly, similar toxic effects and underlying mechanisms including caspase activation, upregulation of PUMA, and downregulation of Mcl-1 were also observed in a p53-null lung cancer H1299 cell line upon destruxin B treatment. Taken together, our findings suggest that destruxin-B-induced apoptosis in human nonsmall cell lung cancer cells is via a Bcl-2 family-dependent mitochondrial pathway.",

Our method then leverages the inferred phylogeny to improve the accuracy of SNV discovery. Experimental analyses demonstrate that our method achieves up to 32% improvement for somatic SNV calling of multiple, related samples over the accuracy of GATK's Unified Genotyper, the state-of-the-art multisample SNV caller.",

Here, we describe the preparation of barcoded and multiplexed DNA libraries followed by hybridization-based capture of targeted exons for the detection of cancer-associated mutations in fresh frozen and FFPE tumors by massively parallel sequencing. This method enables the identification of sequence mutations, copy number alterations, and select structural rearrangements involving all targeted genes.

The advent of a new DNA sequencing technology known as next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized the speed and throughput of cataloguing such cancer-related genomic alterations. Now the challenge is how to exploit this advanced technology to better understand the underlying molecular mechanism of colorectal carcinogenesis and to identify clinically relevant genetic biomarkers for diagnosis and personalized therapeutics. In this review, we will introduce NGS-based cancer genomics studies focusing on those of CRC, including a recent large-scale report from the Cancer Genome Atlas. We will mainly discuss how NGS-based exome-, whole genome- and methylome-sequencing have extended our understanding of colorectal carcinogenesis. We will also introduce the unique genomic features of CRC discovered by NGS technologies, such as the relationship with bacterial pathogens and the massive genomic rearrangements of chromothripsis. Finally, we will discuss the necessary steps prior to development of a clinical application of NGS-related findings for the advanced management of patients with CRC.",

By analyzing >8,200 tumor-normal pairs, we provide statistical evidence suggesting that many more genes possess cancer driver properties than anticipated, forming a continuum of oncogenic potential. Integrating our driver predictions with information on somatic copy number alterations, we find that the distribution and potency of TSGs (STOP genes), OGs, and essential genes (GO genes) on chromosomes can predict the complex patterns of aneuploidy and copy number variation characteristic of cancer genomes.

However, the degree to which the rate of somatic mutation varies across the human genome and the mechanistic basis underlying this variation remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we performed a cross-cancer comparison of 402 whole genomes comprising a diverse set of childhood and adult tumors, including both solid and hematopoietic malignancies. Surprisingly, we found that the inactive X chromosome of many female cancer genomes accumulates on average twice and up to four times as many somatic mutations per megabase, as compared to the individual autosomes. Whole-genome sequencing of clonally expanded hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from healthy individuals and a premalignant myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) sample revealed no X chromosome hypermutation. Our data suggest that hypermutation of the inactive X chromosome is an early and frequent feature of tumorigenesis resulting from DNA replication stress in aberrantly proliferating cells.",

Surprisingly current papilloma virus and mutation theories of carcinomas do not mention these individualities. The viral theory holds that randomly integrated, defective genomes of papilloma viruses, which are often untranscribed, cause cervical carcinomas with unknown cofactors 20-50 years after infection. Virus-free carcinomas are attributed to mutations of a few tumor-suppressor genes, especially the p53 gene. But the paradox of how a few mutations or latent defective viral DNAs would generate carcinomas with endless individual DNA contents, degrees of malignancies and cellular phenotypes is unsolved. Since speciation predicts individuality, we test here the theory that cancers are autonomous species with individual clonal karyotypes and phenotypes. This theory postulates that carcinogens induce aneuploidy. By unbalancing mitosis genes aneuploidy catalyzes chain reactions of karyotypic evolutions. Most such evolutions end with non-viable karyotypes but a few become new cancer karyotypes. Despite congenitally unbalanced mitosis genes cancer karyotypes are stabilized by clonal selections for cancer-specific autonomy.",

Secondary applications include translational areas, such as patient prognosis, therapy control and tumor classification, or grading. Metabolomics is at a developmental stage with respect to epidemiology, with the majority of studies including less than 100 patients. Standardization is required especially concerning sample preparation and data analysis. In the second part of this review, we reconstructed a metabolic network of patients with cancer by quantitatively extracting all reports of altered metabolites: Alterations in energy metabolism, membrane, and fatty acid synthesis emerged, with tryptophan levels changed most frequently in various cancers. Metabolomics has the potential to evolve into a standard tool for future applications in epidemiology and translational cancer research, but further, large-scale studies including prospective validation are needed.",

SCNAs that were internal to chromosomes tended to be shorter than telomere-bounded SCNAs, suggesting different mechanisms underlying their generation. Significantly recurrent focal SCNAs were observed in 140 regions, including 102 without known oncogene or tumor suppressor gene targets and 50 with significantly mutated genes. Amplified regions without known oncogenes were enriched for genes involved in epigenetic regulation. When levels of genomic disruption were accounted for, 7% of region pairs were anticorrelated, and these regions tended to encompass genes whose proteins physically interact, suggesting related functions.

			"abstract": "One of the striking characteristics of cancer cells is their phenotypic diversity and ability to switch phenotypes in response to environmental fluctuations. Such phenotypic changes (e.g. from drug-sensitive to drug-resistant), which are critical for survival and proliferation, are widely believed to arise due to mutations in the cancer cell's genome. However, there is growing concern that such a deterministic view is not entirely consistent with multiple lines of evidence which indicate that cancer can arise in the absence of mutations and can even be reversed to normalcy despite the mutations. In this Commentary, we wish to present an alternate view that highlights how stochasticity in protein interaction networks (PINs) may play a key role in cancer initiation and progression. We highlight the potential role of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and submit that targeting IDPs can lead to new insights and treatment protocols for cancer.",

			"abstract": "Fractal characteristics of chromatin, revealed by light or electron microscopy, have been reported during the last 20 years. Fractal features can easily be estimated in digitalized microscopic images and are helpful for diagnosis and prognosis of neoplasias. During carcinogenesis and tumor progression, an increase of the fractal dimension (FD) of stained nuclei has been shown in intraepithelial lesions of the uterine cervix and the anus, oral squamous cell carcinomas or adenocarcinomas of the pancreas. Furthermore, an increased FD of chromatin is an unfavorable prognostic factor in squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity and the larynx, melanomas and multiple myelomas. High goodness-of-fit of the regression line of the FD is a favorable prognostic factor in acute leukemias and multiple myelomas. The nucleus has fractal and power-law organization in several different levels, which might in part be interrelated. Some possible relations between modifications of the chromatin organization during carcinogenesis and tumor progression and an increase of the FD of stained chromatin are suggested. Furthermore, increased complexity of the chromatin structure, loss of heterochromatin and a less-perfect self-organization of the nucleus in aggressive neoplasias are discussed.",

			"abstract": "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of chronic hematological malignancies characterized by dysplasia, ineffective hematopoiesis and a variable risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia. Sequencing of MDS genomes has identified mutations in genes implicated in RNA splicing, DNA modification, chromatin regulation, and cell signaling. We sequenced 111 genes across 738 patients with MDS or closely related neoplasms (including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and MDS-myeloproliferative neoplasms) to explore the role of acquired mutations in MDS biology and clinical phenotype. Seventy-eight percent of patients had 1 or more oncogenic mutations. We identify complex patterns of pairwise association between genes, indicative of epistatic interactions involving components of the spliceosome machinery and epigenetic modifiers. Coupled with inferences on subclonal mutations, these data suggest a hypothesis of genetic \"predestination,\" in which early driver mutations, typically affecting genes involved in RNA splicing, dictate future trajectories of disease evolution with distinct clinical phenotypes. Driver mutations had equivalent prognostic significance, whether clonal or subclonal, and leukemia-free survival deteriorated steadily as numbers of driver mutations increased. Thus, analysis of oncogenic mutations in large, well-characterized cohorts of patients illustrates the interconnections between the cancer genome and disease biology, with considerable potential for clinical application.",

			"abstract": "During the last decade, the development of anticancer therapies has focused on targeting neoplastic-related metabolism. Cancer cells display a variety of changes in their metabolism, which enable them to satisfy the high bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands for rapid cell division. One of the crucial alterations is referred to as the \"Warburg effect\", which involves a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation towards the less efficient glycolysis, independent of the presence of oxygen. Although there are many examples of solid tumors having altered metabolism with high rates of glucose uptake and glycolysis, it was only recently reported that this phenomenon occurs in hematological malignancies. This review presents evidence that targeting the glycolytic pathway at different levels in hematological malignancies can inhibit cancer cell proliferation by restoring normal metabolic conditions. However, to achieve cancer regression, high concentrations of glycolytic inhibitors are used due to limited solubility and biodistribution, which may result in toxicity. Besides using these inhibitors as monotherapies, combinatorial approaches using standard chemotherapeutic agents could display enhanced efficacy at eradicating malignant cells. The identification of the metabolic enzymes critical for hematological cancer cell proliferation and survival appears to be an interesting new approach for the targeted therapy of hematological malignancies.",

			"abstract": "The identification of cancer drivers is a major goal of current cancer research. Finding driver genes within large chromosomal events is especially challenging because such alterations encompass many genes. Previously, we demonstrated that zebrafish malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are highly aneuploid, much like human tumors. In this study, we examined 147 zebrafish MPNSTs by massively parallel sequencing and identified both large and focal copy number alterations (CNAs). Given the low degree of conserved synteny between fish and mammals, we reasoned that comparative analyses of CNAs from fish versus human MPNSTs would enable elimination of a large proportion of passenger mutations, especially on large CNAs. We established a list of orthologous genes between human and zebrafish, which includes approximately two-thirds of human protein-coding genes. For the subset of these genes found in human MPNST CNAs, only one quarter of their orthologues were co-gained or co-lost in zebrafish, dramatically narrowing the list of candidate cancer drivers for both focal and large CNAs. We conclude that zebrafish-human comparative analysis represents a powerful, and broadly applicable, tool to enrich for evolutionarily conserved cancer drivers.",

			"abstract": "Cancers are caused by the accumulation of genomic alterations. Driver mutations are required for the cancer phenotype, whereas passenger mutations are irrelevant to tumor development and accumulate through DNA replication. A major challenge facing the field of cancer genome sequencing is to identify cancer-associated genes with mutations that drive the cancer phenotype. Here, we describe a powerful and flexible statistical framework for identifying driver genes and driver signaling pathways in cancer genome-sequencing studies. Biological knowledge of the mutational process in tumors is fully integrated into our statistical models and includes such variables as the length of protein-coding regions, transcript isoforms, variation in mutation types, differences in background mutation rates, the redundancy of genetic code, and multiple mutations in one gene. This framework provides several significant features that are not addressed or naively obtained by previous methods. In particular, on the observation of low prevalence of somatic mutations in individual tumors, we propose a heuristic strategy to estimate the mixture proportion of chi-square distribution of likelihood ratio test (LRT) statistics. This provides significantly increased statistical power compared to regular LRT. Through a combination of simulation and analysis of TCGA cancer sequencing study data, we demonstrate high accuracy and sensitivity in our methods. Our statistical methods and several auxiliary bioinformatics tools have been incorporated into a computational tool, DrGaP. The newly developed tool is immediately applicable to cancer genome-sequencing studies and will lead to a more complete identification of altered driver genes and driver signaling pathways in cancer.",

			"abstract": "All cancers are caused by somatic mutations; however, understanding of the biological processes generating these mutations is limited. The catalogue of somatic mutations from a cancer genome bears the signatures of the mutational processes that have been operative. Here we analysed 4,938,362 mutations from 7,042 cancers and extracted more than 20 distinct mutational signatures. Some are present in many cancer types, notably a signature attributed to the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases, whereas others are confined to a single cancer class. Certain signatures are associated with age of the patient at cancer diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures or defects in DNA maintenance, but many are of cryptic origin. In addition to these genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation localized to small genomic regions, 'kataegis', is found in many cancer types. The results reveal the diversity of mutational processes underlying the development of cancer, with potential implications for understanding of cancer aetiology, prevention and therapy.",

			"abstract": "A Boolean dynamical system integrating the main signaling pathways involved in cancer is constructed based on the currently known protein-protein interaction network. This system exhibits stationary protein activation patterns--attractors--dependent on the cell's microenvironment. These dynamical attractors were determined through simulations and their stabilities against mutations were tested. In a higher hierarchical level, it was possible to group the network attractors into distinct cell phenotypes and determine driver mutations that promote phenotypic transitions. We find that driver nodes are not necessarily central in the network topology, but at least they are direct regulators of central components towards which converge or through which crosstalk distinct cancer signaling pathways. The predicted drivers are in agreement with those pointed out by diverse census of cancer genes recently performed for several human cancers. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that cell phenotypes can evolve towards full malignancy through distinct sequences of accumulated mutations. In particular, the network model supports routes of carcinogenesis known for some tumor types. Finally, the Boolean network model is employed to evaluate the outcome of molecularly targeted cancer therapies. The major find is that monotherapies were additive in their effects and that the association of targeted drugs is necessary for cancer eradication.",

Through complementarity with messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences, miRNAs act primarily to silence gene expression through either degradation or inhibited translation of target transcripts. In this way, miRNAs can act to fine-tune the transcriptional regulation of gene expression, but they may also play distinct roles in the proliferation, differentiation, and function of specific cell types. miRNA regulatory networks may be particularly important for signaling molecules such as vitamin D that exert pleiotropic effects on tissues throughout the body. The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) functions as a steroid hormone that, when bound to its nuclear vitamin D receptor, is able to regulate target gene expression. However, recent studies have also implicated 1,25(OH)2D in epigenetic regulation of genes most notably as a modulator of miRNA function. The current review details our understanding of vitamin D and miRNAs with specific emphasis on the implications of this interaction for biological responses to vitamin D in one of its classical target tissues, i.e., bone.",

Using fusion peptide multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry in a clinically relevant scenario, we demonstrate the specific, sensitive, and unambiguous detection of a specific diagnostic fusion peptide in clinical samples of anaplastic large cell lymphoma, but not in a diverse array of benign lymph nodes or other forms of primary malignant lymphomas and cancer-derived cell lines. Our studies highlight the utility of fusion peptides as cancer biomarkers and carry broad implications for the use of protein biomarkers in cancer detection and monitoring.",

			"abstract": "It is poorly understood how driver mutations in cancer genes work together to promote tumor development. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) offers a unique opportunity to study complex relationships among cancer genes. The four most commonly mutated genes in RCC of clear-cell type (the most common type) are two-hit tumor suppressor genes, and they cluster in a 43-Mb region on chromosome 3p that is deleted in approximately 90% of tumors: VHL (mutated in \u223c80%), PBRM1 (\u223c50%), BAP1 (\u223c15%), and SETD2 (\u223c15%). Meta-analyses that we conducted show that mutations in PBRM1 and SETD2 co-occur in tumors at a frequency higher than expected by chance alone, indicating that these mutations may cooperate in tumorigenesis. In contrast, consistent with our previous results, mutations in PBRM1 and BAP1 tend to be mutually exclusive. Mutation exclusivity analyses (often confounded by lack of statistical power) raise the possibility of functional redundancy. However, mutation exclusivity may indicate negative genetic interactions, as proposed herein for PBRM1 and BAP1, and mutations in these genes define RCC with different pathologic features, gene expression profiles, and outcomes. Negative genetic interactions among cancer genes point toward broader context dependencies of cancer gene action beyond tissue dependencies. An enhanced understanding of cancer gene dependencies may help to unravel vulnerabilities that can be exploited therapeutically.",

Pharmacological inhibition or genetic down-regulation of the mTOR pathway resulted in increase of ATM mRNA and protein both in mouse sarcoma xenografts and cultured cells. mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) suppresses ATM via S6K1/2 signaling pathways. microRNA-18a and microRNA-421, both of which target ATM, are positively controlled by mTOR signaling. Our findings have identified a negative feedback loop for the signaling between ATM and mTOR pathways and suggest that oncogenic growth signals may promote tumorigenesis by dampening the ATM checkpoint.",

While numerous research groups are usefully employing this kind of functional genomic methodology to identify molecular mediators of disease severity, response, and resistance to treatment, findings are generally confounded by \"off-target\" effects. These effects arise from a variety of issues beyond non-specific reagent behavior, such as biological cross-talk and feedback processes so thus can occur even with specific perturbation. Interpreting RNAi results in a network framework instead of merely as individual \"hits\" or \"targets\" leverages contributions from all hit/target contributions to pathways via their relationships with other network nodes. This interpretation can ameliorate dependence upon individual reagent performance and increase confidence in biological validation. Here we provide background on RNAi studies in cancer applications, review key challenges with functional genomics, and motivate the use of network models grounded in pathway analyses.",

			"abstract": "High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) is characterized by poor outcome, often attributed to the emergence of treatment-resistant subclones. We sought to measure the degree of genomic diversity within primary, untreated HGSCs to examine the natural state of tumour evolution prior to therapy. We performed exome sequencing, copy number analysis, targeted amplicon deep sequencing and gene expression profiling on 31 spatially and temporally separated HGSC tumour specimens (six patients), including ovarian masses, distant metastases and fallopian tube lesions. We found widespread intratumoural variation in mutation, copy number and gene expression profiles, with key driver alterations in genes present in only a subset of samples (eg PIK3CA, CTNNB1, NF1). On average, only 51.5% of mutations were present in every sample of a given case (range 10.2-91.4%), with TP53 as the only somatic mutation consistently present in all samples. Complex segmental aneuploidies, such as whole-genome doubling, were present in a subset of samples from the same individual, with divergent copy number changes segregating independently of point mutation acquisition. Reconstruction of evolutionary histories showed one patient with mixed HGSC and endometrioid histology, with common aetiologic origin in the fallopian tube and subsequent selection of different driver mutations in the histologically distinct samples. In this patient, we observed mixed cell populations in the early fallopian tube lesion, indicating that diversity arises at early stages of tumourigenesis. Our results revealed that HGSCs exhibit highly individual evolutionary trajectories and diverse genomic tapestries prior to therapy, exposing an essential biological characteristic to inform future design of personalized therapeutic solutions and investigation of drug-resistance mechanisms.",

It has been suggested that changes in the equilibrium between its active and inactive conformations are linked to its oncogenic potential. Here, we quantify the effects of some of the most common single (L858R and T790M) and double (T790M-L858R) oncogenic mutations on the conformational free-energy landscape of the EGFR kinase domain by using massive molecular dynamics simulations together with parallel tempering, metadynamics, and one of the best force-fields available. Whereas the wild-type EGFR catalytic domain monomer is mostly found in an inactive conformation, our results show a clear shift toward the active conformation for all of the mutants. The L858R mutation stabilizes the active conformation at the expense of the inactive conformation and rigidifies the \u03b1C-helix. The T790M gatekeeper mutant favors activation by stabilizing a hydrophobic cluster. Finally, T790M with L858R shows a significant positive epistasis effect. This combination not only stabilizes the active conformation, but in nontrivial ways changes the free-energy landscape lowering the transition barriers.",

			"abstract": "Cancers are rarely caused by single mutations, but often develop as a result of the combined effects of multiple mutations. For most cells, the number of possible cell divisions is limited because of various biological constraints, such as progressive telomere shortening, cell senescence cascades or a hierarchically organized tissue structure. Thus, the risk of accumulating cells carrying multiple mutations is low. Nonetheless, many diseases are based on the accumulation of such multiple mutations. We model a general, hierarchically organized tissue by a multi-compartment approach, allowing any number of mutations within a cell. We derive closed solutions for the deterministic clonal dynamics and the reproductive capacity of single clones. Our results hold for the average dynamics in a hierarchical tissue characterized by an arbitrary combination of proliferation parameters. We show that hierarchically organized tissues strongly suppress cells carrying multiple mutations and derive closed solutions for the expected size and diversity of clonal populations founded by a single mutant within the hierarchy. We discuss the example of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in detail and find good agreement between our predicted results and recently observed clonal diversities in patients. This result can contribute to the explanation of very diverse mutation profiles observed by whole genome sequencing of many different cancers.",

			"abstract": "Drug designing targeting protein-protein interactions is challenging. Because structural elucidation and computational analysis have revealed the importance of hot spot residues in stabilizing these interactions, there have been on-going efforts to develop drugs which bind the hot spots and out-compete the native protein partners. The question arises as to what are the key 'druggable' properties of hot spots in protein-protein interactions and whether these mimic the general hot spot definition. Identification of orthosteric (at the protein- protein interaction site) and allosteric (elsewhere) druggable hot spots is expected to help in discovering compounds that can more effectively modulate protein-protein interactions. For example, are there any other significant features beyond their location in pockets in the interface? The interactions of protein-protein hot spots are coupled with conformational dynamics of protein complexes. Currently increasing efforts focus on the allosteric drug discovery. Allosteric drugs bind away from the native binding site and can modulate the native interactions. We propose that identification of allosteric hot spots could similarly help in more effective allosteric drug discovery. While detection of allosteric hot spots is challenging, targeting drugs to these residues has the potential of greatly increasing the hot spot and protein druggability.",

Quantifying the expression and PTMs of biomarkers such as ErbB2 by selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mass spectrometry has several limitations, including minimal coverage and extensive assay development time. Therefore, we assessed the utility of two high resolution, full scan mass spectrometry approaches, MS1 Filtering and SWATH MS2, for targeted ErbB2 proteomics. Endogenous ErbB2 immunoprecipitated from SK-BR-3 cells was in-gel digested with trypsin, chymotrypsin, Asp-N, or trypsin plus Asp-N in triplicate. Data-dependent acquisition with an AB SCIEX TripleTOF 5600 and MS1 Filtering data processing was used to assess peptide and PTM coverage as well as the reproducibility of enzyme digestion. Data-independent acquisition (SWATH) was also performed for MS2 quantitation. MS1 Filtering and SWATH MS2 allow quantitation of all detected analytes after acquisition, enabling the use of multiple proteases for quantitative assessment of target proteins. Combining high resolution proteomics with multiprotease digestion enabled quantitative mapping of ErbB2 with excellent reproducibility, improved amino acid sequence and PTM coverage, and decreased assay development time compared to typical SRM assays. These results demonstrate that high resolution quantitative proteomic approaches are an effective tool for targeted biomarker quantitation.",

It is clear that the prognosis of individual patients is strongly influenced by the combination of mutations in their leukaemia and that many leukaemias are composed of multiple subclones, with differential susceptibilities to treatment. Here, we describe a method, employing targeted capture coupled with next-generation sequencing and tailored bioinformatic analysis, for the simultaneous study of 24 genes recurrently mutated in AML-NK. Mutational analysis was performed using open source software and an in-house script (Mutation Identification and Analysis Software), which identified dominant clone mutations with 100% specificity. In each of seven cases of AML-NK studied, we identified and verified mutations in 2-4 genes in the main leukaemic clone. Additionally, high sequencing depth enabled us to identify putative subclonal mutations and detect leukaemia-specific mutations in DNA from remission marrow. Finally, we used normalised read depths to detect copy number changes and identified and subsequently verified a tandem duplication of exons 2-9 of MLL and at least one deletion involving PTEN. This methodology reliably detects sequence and copy number mutations, and can thus greatly facilitate the classification, clinical research, diagnosis and management of AML-NK.",

The number, identity and mode of action of cancer driver genes, and how they contribute to tumor evolution is largely unknown. This study deployed the Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV) as an insertional mutagen to find both the driver genes and the networks in which they function. Using deep insertion site sequencing we identified around 31000 retroviral integration sites in 604 MMTV-induced mammary tumors from mice with mammary gland-specific deletion of Trp53, Pten heterozygous knockout mice, or wildtype strains. We identified 18 known common integration sites (CISs) and 12 previously unknown CISs marking new candidate cancer genes. Members of the Wnt, Fgf, Fgfr, Rspo and Pdgfr gene families were commonly mutated in a mutually exclusive fashion. The sequence data we generated yielded also information on the clonality of insertions in individual tumors, allowing us to develop a data-driven model of MMTV-induced tumor development. Insertional mutations near Wnt and Fgf genes mark the earliest \"initiating\" events in MMTV induced tumorigenesis, whereas Fgfr genes are targeted later during tumor progression. Our data shows that insertional mutagenesis can be used to discover the mutational networks, the timing of mutations, and the genes that initiate and drive tumor evolution.",

While recent reports have shed some light on these aspects, several challenges need to be addressed before translating this research into clinical practice. Thus, even the best candidate driver genes display low mutational rates compared to other tumors. This means that a large percentage of cases do not display clear tumor-driving point mutations, or show candidate driving point mutations with no obvious biochemical relationship to the more frequently mutated genes. This genomic landscape probably reflects either an unknown underlying biochemical mechanism playing a key role in CLL or multiple biochemical pathways independently driving the development of this tumor. The elucidation of either scenario will have important consequences on the clinical management of CLL. Herein, we review the recent advances in the definition of the genomic landscape of CLL and the ongoing research to characterize the underlying biochemical events that drive this disease.",

We previously defined two classes of conserved disordered regions in budding yeast, referred to as \"flexible\" and \"constrained\" conserved disorder. In flexible disorder, the property of disorder has been positionally conserved during evolution, whereas in constrained disorder, both the amino acid sequence and the property of disorder have been conserved. Here, we show that flexible and constrained disorder are widespread in the human proteome, and are particularly common in proteins with regulatory functions. Both classes of disordered sequences are highly enriched in regions of proteins that undergo tissue-specific (TS) alternative splicing (AS), but not in regions of proteins that undergo general (i.e., not tissue-regulated) AS. Flexible disorder is more highly enriched in TS alternative exons, whereas constrained disorder is more highly enriched in exons that flank TS alternative exons. These latter regions are also significantly more enriched in potential phosphosites and other short linear motifs associated with cell signaling. We further show that cancer driver mutations are significantly enriched in regions of proteins associated with TS and general AS. Collectively, our results point to distinct roles for TS alternative exons and flanking exons in the dynamic regulation of protein interaction networks in response to signaling activity, and they further suggest that alternatively spliced regions of proteins are often functionally altered by mutations responsible for cancer.",

			"abstract": "The nature and pace of genome mutation is largely unknown. Because standard methods sequence DNA from populations of cells, the genetic composition of individual cells is lost, de novo mutations in cells are concealed within the bulk signal and per cell cycle mutation rates and mechanisms remain elusive. Although single-cell genome analyses could resolve these problems, such analyses are error-prone because of whole-genome amplification (WGA) artefacts and are limited in the types of DNA mutation that can be discerned. We developed methods for paired-end sequence analysis of single-cell WGA products that enable (i) detecting multiple classes of DNA mutation, (ii) distinguishing DNA copy number changes from allelic WGA-amplification artefacts by the discovery of matching aberrantly mapping read pairs among the surfeit of paired-end WGA and mapping artefacts and (iii) delineating the break points and architecture of structural variants. By applying the methods, we capture DNA copy number changes acquired over one cell cycle in breast cancer cells and in blastomeres derived from a human zygote after in vitro fertilization. Furthermore, we were able to discover and fine-map a heritable inter-chromosomal rearrangement t(1;16)(p36;p12) by sequencing a single blastomere. The methods will expedite applications in basic genome research and provide a stepping stone to novel approaches for clinical genetic diagnosis.",

We searched for somatic mutations from 10 pairs of tumor and normal cells by using a highly efficient and reliable analysis workflow for whole-exome sequencing data and performed association tests between the NK-AML and somatic mutations. We identified 21 nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) located in a coding region of 18 genes. Among them, the SNVs of three leukemia-related genes (MUC4, CNTNAP2, and GNAS) reported in previous studies were replicated in this study. We conducted stepwise genetic risk score (GRS) models composed of the NK-AML susceptible variants and evaluated the prediction accuracy of each GRS model by computing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The GRS model that was composed of five SNVs (rs75156964, rs56213454, rs6604516, rs10888338, and rs2443878) showed 100% prediction accuracy, and the combined effect of the three reported genes was validated in the current study (AUC, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.92 to 1.00). Further study with large sample sizes is warranted to validate the combined effect of these somatic point mutations, and the discovery of novel markers may provide an opportunity to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets for NK-AML.",

			"abstract": "The introduction of next generation sequencing methods in genome studies has made it possible to shift research from a gene-centric approach to a genome wide view. Although methods and tools to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms are becoming more mature, methods to identify and visualize structural variation (SV) are still in their infancy. Most genome browsers can only compare a given sequence to a reference genome; therefore, direct comparison of multiple individuals still remains a challenge. Therefore, the implementation of efficient approaches to explore and visualize SVs and directly compare two or more individuals is desirable. In this article, we present a visualization approach that uses space-filling Hilbert curves to explore SVs based on both read-depth and pair-end information. An interactive open-source Java application, called Meander, implements the proposed methodology, and its functionality is demonstrated using two cases. With Meander, users can explore variations at different levels of resolution and simultaneously compare up to four different individuals against a common reference. The application was developed using Java version 1.6 and Processing.org and can be run on any platform. It can be found at http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~bioiuser/meander.",

However, it is not known how the expression of metabolic genes in tumors differs from that in normal tissues, or whether different tumor types exhibit similar metabolic changes. Here we compare expression patterns of metabolic genes across 22 diverse types of human tumors. Overall, the metabolic gene expression program in tumors is similar to that in the corresponding normal tissues. Although expression changes of some metabolic pathways (e.g., upregulation of nucleotide biosynthesis and glycolysis) are frequently observed across tumors, expression changes of other pathways (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation) are very heterogeneous. Our analysis also suggests that the expression changes of some metabolic genes (e.g., isocitrate dehydrogenase and fumarate hydratase) may enhance or mimic the effects of recurrent mutations in tumors. On the level of individual biochemical reactions, many hundreds of metabolic isoenzymes show significant and tumor-specific expression changes. These isoenzymes are potential targets for anticancer therapy.",

			"abstract": "Copy number alterations are frequently found in colorectal cancer (CRC), and recurrent gains or losses are likely to correspond to regions harbouring genes that promote or impede carcinogenesis respectively. Gain of chromosome 13q is common in CRC but, because the region of gain is frequently large, identification of the driver gene(s) has hitherto proved difficult. We used array comparative genomic hybridization to analyse 124 primary CRCs, demonstrating that 13q34 is a region of gain in 35% of CRCs, with focal gains in 4% and amplification in a further 1.6% of cases. To reduce the number of potential driver genes to consider, it was necessary to refine the boundaries of the narrowest copy number changes seen in this series and hence define the minimal copy region (MCR). This was performed using molecular copy-number counting, identifying IRS2 as the only complete gene, and therefore the likely driver oncogene, within the refined MCR. Analysis of available colorectal neoplasia data sets confirmed IRS2 gene gain as a common event. Furthermore, IRS2 protein and mRNA expression in colorectal neoplasia was assessed and was positively correlated with progression from normal through adenoma to carcinoma. In functional in vitro experiments, we demonstrate that deregulated expression of IRS2 activates the oncogenic PI3 kinase pathway and increases cell adhesion, both characteristics of invasive CRC cells. Together, these data identify IRS2 as a likely driver oncogene in the prevalent 13q34 region of gain/amplification and suggest that IRS2 over-expression may provide an additional mechanism of PI3 kinase pathway activation in CRC.",

As most mutations likely occur randomly, cancer driver mutations can only be found if they are recurrent. Here we use exome sequencing of the mouse cell lines Panc02, L1210 and Colon 26 to identify genetic alterations (single-nucleotide polymorphisms and small insertion and deletions) that occurred in three different strains of mice and that resulted in tumorigenesis. We identify known mutations in genes like Kras, Cdkn2a/b, Smad4 and Trp53 and a large list of genes whose causal link to cancer is unknown. Interestingly, by screening a compound library we find that the identified oncogenic Kras mutation in Colon 26 cells correlates with its sensitivity to MEK inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. Our analysis of these mouse tumor exomes show that their manageable number of mutations could facilitate the identification of novel mutations or pathways driving tumor development. Furthermore, their use as tools is now enhanced as they can be used to create syngenic transplant models for utilization in drug discovery and validation. Finally, by showing that Kras mutant Colon 26 cells are sensitive to MEK inhibitors, we provide one proof-of-principle experiment that a platform containing targeted resequencing and drug screens could be a valuable addition in the clinic to devise anti-cancer drug schemes.",

			"abstract": "p53 gain-of-function mutations are similar to driver mutations in cancer genes, with both promoting tumorigenesis. Most previous studies focused on residues lost by mutations, providing information related to a dominantly-negative effect. However, to understand gain-of-function mutations, it is also important to investigate what are the distributions of residues gained by mutations. We compile available p53/p63/p73 protein sequences and construct a non-redundant dataset. We analyze the amino acid and dipeptide composition of p53/p63/p73 proteins across evolution and compare them with the gain/loss of amino acids and dipeptides in human p53 following cancer-related somatic mutations. We find that the ratios of amino acids gained via somatic mutations during evolution to those lost through p53 cancer mutations correlate with the ratios found in single nucleotide polymorphisms in the human proteome. The dipeptide mutational gain/loss ratios are inversely correlated with those observed over p53 evolution but tend to follow the increasing p63/p73-like dipeptide propensities. We successfully simulated the p53 cancer mutation spectrum using the dipeptide composition across the p53 family accounting for the likelihood of mutations in p53 codons. The results revealed that the p53 mutation spectrum is dominated not only by p53 evolution but also by reversal of evolution to a certain degree.

			"abstract": "Anti-Gal is the most abundant natural antibody in humans, constituting ~\u00a01% of immunoglobulins. Anti-Gal is naturally produced also in apes and Old World monkeys. The ligand of anti-Gal is a carbohydrate antigen called the '\u03b1-gal epitope' with the structure Gal\u03b11-3Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc-R. The \u03b1-gal epitope is present as a major carbohydrate antigen in non-primate mammals, prosimians and New World monkeys. Anti-Gal can contributes to several immunological pathogeneses. Anti-Gal IgE produced in some individuals causes allergies to meat and to the therapeutic monoclonal antibody cetuximab, all presenting \u03b1-gal epitopes. Aberrant expression of the \u03b1-gal epitope or of antigens mimicking it in humans may result in autoimmune processes, as in Graves' disease. \u03b1-Gal epitopes produced by Trypanosoma cruzi interact with anti-Gal and induce 'autoimmune like' inflammatory reactions in Chagas' disease. Anti-Gal IgM and IgG further mediate rejection of xenografts expressing \u03b1-gal epitopes. Because of its abundance, anti-Gal may be exploited for various clinical uses. It increases immunogenicity of microbial vaccines (e.g. influenza vaccine) presenting \u03b1-gal epitopes by targeting them for effective uptake by antigen-presenting cells. Tumour lesions are converted into vaccines against autologous tumour-associated antigens by intra-tumoral injection of \u03b1-gal glycolipids, which insert into tumour cell membranes. Anti-Gal binding to \u03b1-gal epitopes on tumour cells targets them for uptake by antigen-presenting cells. Accelerated wound healing is achieved by application of \u03b1-gal nanoparticles, which bind anti-Gal, activate complement, and recruit and activate macrophages that induce tissue regeneration. This therapy may be of further significance in regeneration of internally injured tissues such as ischaemic myocardium and injured nerves.",

			"abstract": "Cancer evolution involves cycles of genomic damage, epigenetic deregulation, and increased cellular proliferation that eventually culminate in the carcinoma phenotype. Early neoplasias, which are often found concurrently with carcinomas and are histologically distinguishable from normal breast tissue, are less advanced in phenotype than carcinomas and are thought to represent precursor stages. To elucidate their role in cancer evolution we performed comparative whole-genome sequencing of early neoplasias, matched normal tissue, and carcinomas from six patients, for a total of 31 samples. By using somatic mutations as lineage markers we built trees that relate the tissue samples within each patient. On the basis of these lineage trees we inferred the order, timing, and rates of genomic events. In four out of six cases, an early neoplasia and the carcinoma share a mutated common ancestor with recurring aneuploidies, and in all six cases evolution accelerated in the carcinoma lineage. Transition spectra of somatic mutations are stable and consistent across cases, suggesting that accumulation of somatic mutations is a result of increased ancestral cell division rather than specific mutational mechanisms. In contrast to highly advanced tumors that are the focus of much of the current cancer genome sequencing, neither the early neoplasia genomes nor the carcinomas are enriched with potentially functional somatic point mutations. Aneuploidies that occur in common ancestors of neoplastic and tumor cells are the earliest events that affect a large number of genes and may predispose breast tissue to eventual development of invasive carcinoma.",

			"abstract": "Of all the diseases affecting humankind, cancer is one of the most difficult to treat and cure. One of the main reasons for this difficulty relates to the fact that cancer is not a single disease but consists of hundreds of different types. Furthermore, cancers exhibit considerable genetic complexity with more than 400 different genes implicated in their development. In addition, cancers display major inter- and intratumor heterogeneity. Despite these complexities, several successes have been achieved in recent years. Most of these successes relate to the specific targeting of driver genes involved in cancer development. These successes include imatinib for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia, anti-HER2 therapies (trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and lapatinib) to treat breast cancer, anti-EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib and erlotinib) to treat non-small cell lung cancer, and anti-BRAF agents (vemurafenib and dabrafenib) to treat melanoma. Although the war on cancer has not yet been won, neither has it been lost. With continued basic and clinical research, cancer is being transformed into a chronic disease in which patients have increased survival rates and better quality of life.",

We analyzed sporadic villous and tubulovillous adenomas, in situ carcinomas, and primary colorectal carcinomas from multiple patients. The cancers were further evaluated for mucinous status and microsatellite instability. Standard PCR molecular techniques were used for KRAS and microsatellite analyses. A KRAS mutation was found in 61.9% of 134 adenomas, 67.8% of 84 in situ carcinomas, and just 31.6% of 171 carcinomas. Our study clearly demonstrates that tubulovillous and villous adenomas, as well as both the benign and malignant parts of in situ carcinomas, are statistically more likely to contain a somatic KRAS gene mutation than colorectal carcinomas. This difference is confined to the non-mucinous and the microsatellite stable tumors. Our data support the possibility that non-mucinous and microsatellite stable carcinomas with wild-type KRAS gene may have had a mutation in the KRAS gene during their earlier stages, with the mutation lost during further growth.",

			"abstract": "When fighting cancer, knowledge on metabolism has always been important. Today, it matters more than ever. The restricted cataloging of cancer genomes is quite unlikely to achieve the task of curing cancer, unless it is integrated into metabolic networks that respond to and influence the constantly evolving cancer stem cell (CSC) cellular states. Once the genomic era of carcinogenesis had pushed the 1920s Otto Warburg's metabolic cancer hypothesis into obscurity for decades, the most recent studies begin to support a new developing paradigm, in which the molecular logic behind the conversion of non-CSCs into CSCs can be better understood in terms of the \"metabolic facilitators\" and \"metabolic impediments\" that operate as proximate openings and roadblocks, respectively, for the transcriptional events and signal transduction programs that ultimately orchestrate the intrinsic and/or microenvironmental paths to CSC cellular states. Here we propose that a profound understanding of how human carcinomas install a proper \"Warburg effect version 2.0\" allowing them to \"run\" the CSCs' \"software\" programs should guide a new era of metabolo-genomic-personalized cancer medicine. By viewing metabolic reprogramming of CSCs as an essential characteristic that allows dynamic, multidimensional and evolving cancer populations to compete successfully for their expansion on the organism, we now argue that CSCs bioenergetics might be another cancer hallmark. A definitive understanding of metabolic reprogramming in CSCs may complement or to some extent replace, the 30-y-old paradigm of targeting oncogenes to treat human carcinomas, because it can be possible to metabolically create non-permissive or \"hostile\" metabotypes to prevent the occurrence of CSC cellular states with tumor- and metastasis-initiating capacity.",

			"abstract": "The discovery of RET fusions in lung cancers has uncovered a new therapeutic target for patients whose tumors harbor these changes. In an unselected population of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs), RET fusions are present in 1% to 2% of cases. This incidence increases substantially, however, in never-smokers with lung adenocarcinomas that lack other known driver oncogenes. Although preclinical data provide experimental support for the use of RET inhibitors in the treatment of RET fusion-positive tumors, clinical data on response are lacking. We report preliminary data for the first three patients treated with the RET inhibitor cabozantinib on a prospective phase II trial for patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLCs (NCT01639508). Confirmed partial responses were observed in 2 patients, including one harboring a novel TRIM33-RET fusion. A third patient with a KIF5B-RET fusion has had prolonged stable disease approaching 8 months (31 weeks). All three patients remain progression-free on treatment.",

In this review, we discuss different mechanisms adapted by cancerous cells to resist treatment, including alteration in drug transport and metabolism, mutation and amplification of drug targets, as well as genetic rewiring which can lead to impaired apoptosis. Tumor heterogeneity may also contribute to resistance, where small subpopulations of cells may acquire or stochastically already possess some of the features enabling them to emerge under selective drug pressure. Making the problem even more challenging, some of these resistance pathways lead to multidrug resistance, generating an even more difficult clinical problem to overcome. We provide examples of these mechanisms and some insights into how understanding these processes can influence the next generation of cancer therapies.",

Potential natural and cryptic mRNA splicing variants are identified, and null mutations are distinguished from leaky mutations. Mutations and rare SNPs were predicted in genomes of three cancer cell lines (U2OS, U251 and A431), which were supported by expression analyses. After filtering, tractable numbers of potentially deleterious variants are predicted by the software, suitable for further laboratory investigation. In these cell lines, novel functional variants comprised 6-17 inactivating mutations, 1-5 leaky mutations and 6-13 cryptic splicing mutations. Predicted effects were validated by RNA-seq analysis of the three aforementioned cancer cell lines, and expression microarray analysis of SNPs in HapMap cell lines.",

Recently, locus-specific observations showed that 'self-chain' (SC), a group of short low-copy repeats (LCRs) in the human genome, can induce autism-associated SV mutations of the MECP2 and NRXN1 genes. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide analysis to investigate SCs and their potential roles in genomic SV formation. Utilizing a vast amount of human SV data, we observed a significant biased distribution of human germline SV breakpoints to SC regions. Notably, the breakpoint distribution pattern is different between SV types across deletion, duplication, inversion and insertion. Our observations were coincident with a mechanism of SC-induced DNA replicative errors, whereas SC may sporadically be used as substrates of nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR). This contention was further supported by our consistent findings in somatic SV mutations of cancer genomes, suggesting a general mechanism of SC-induced genome instability in human germ and somatic cells.",

			"abstract": "The calcium-activated chloride channel anoctamin 1 (ANO1) is located within the 11q13 amplicon, one of the most frequently amplified chromosomal regions in human cancer, but its functional role in tumorigenesis has remained unclear. The 11q13 region is amplified in \u223c15% of breast cancers. Whether ANO1 is amplified in breast tumors, the extent to which gene amplification contributes to ANO1 overexpression, and whether overexpression of ANO1 is important for tumor maintenance have remained unknown. We have found that ANO1 is amplified and highly expressed in breast cancer cell lines and primary tumors. Amplification of ANO1 correlated with disease grade and poor prognosis. Knockdown of ANO1 in ANO1-amplified breast cancer cell lines and other cancers bearing 11q13 amplification inhibited proliferation, induced apoptosis, and reduced tumor growth in established cancer xenografts. Moreover, ANO1 chloride channel activity was important for cell viability. Mechanistically, ANO1 knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of its chloride-channel activity reduced EGF receptor (EGFR) and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMKII) signaling, which subsequently attenuated AKT, v-src sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (SRC), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in vitro and in vivo. Our results highlight the involvement of the ANO1 chloride channel in tumor progression and provide insights into oncogenic signaling in human cancers with 11q13 amplification, thereby establishing ANO1 as a promising target for therapy in these highly prevalent tumor types.",

Many single-nucleotide substitutions in cancer genomes arise because of errors in DNA replication, which is spatio-temporally stratified. Here we propose that DNA replication patterns help shape the mutational landscapes of normal and cancer genomes. Using data on five fully sequenced cancer types and two personal genomes, we determined that the frequency of intergenic single-nucleotide substitution is significantly higher in late DNA replication timing regions, even after controlling for a number of genomic features. Furthermore, some substitution signatures are more frequent in certain DNA replication timing zones. Finally, integrating data on higher-order nuclear organization, we found that genomic regions in close spatial proximity to late-replicating domains display similar mutation spectra as the late-replicating regions themselves. These data suggest that DNA replication timing together with higher-order genomic organization contribute to the patterns of single-nucleotide substitution in normal and cancer genomes.",

			"abstract": "Tumorigenesis can be seen as an evolutionary process, in which the transformation of a normal cell into a tumor cell involves a number of limiting genetic and epigenetic events, occurring in a series of discrete stages. However, not all mutations in a cell are directly involved in cancer development and it is likely that most of them (passenger mutations) do not contribute in any way to tumorigenesis. Moreover, the process of tumor evolution is punctuated by selection of advantageous (driver) mutations and clonal expansions. Regarding these driver mutations, it is uncertain how many limiting events are required and/or sufficient to promote a tumorigenic process or what are the values associated with the adaptive advantage of different driver mutations. In spite of the availability of high-quality cancer data, several assumptions about the mechanistic process of cancer initiation and development remain largely untested, both mathematically and statistically. Here we review the development of recent mathematical/computational models and discuss their impact in the field of tumor biology.",

			"abstract": "Herein we report a proof-of-principle study illustrating a novel dog-human comparison strategy that addresses a central aim of cancer research, namely cancer driver-passenger distinction. We previously demonstrated that sporadic canine colorectal cancers (CRCs) share similar molecular pathogenesis mechanisms as their human counterparts. In this study, we compared the genome-wide copy number abnormalities between 29 human and 10 canine sporadic CRCs. This led to the identification of 73 driver candidate genes (DCGs), altered in both species, and with 27 from the whole genome and 46 from dog-human genomic rearrangement breakpoint (GRB) regions, as well as 38 passenger candidate genes (PCGs), altered in humans only and located in GRB regions. We noted that DCGs significantly differ from PCGs in every analysis conducted to assess their cancer relevance and biological functions. Importantly, although PCGs are not enriched in any specific functions, DCGs possess significantly enhanced functionality closely associated with cell proliferation and death regulation, as well as with epithelial cell apicobasal polarity establishment/maintenance. These observations support the notion that, in sporadic CRCs of both species, cell polarity genes not only contribute in preventing cancer cell invasion and spreading, but also likely serve as tumor suppressors by modulating cell growth. This pilot study validates our novel strategy and has uncovered four new potential cell polarity and colorectal tumor suppressor genes (RASA3, NUPL1, DENND5A and AVL9). Expansion of this study would make more driver-passenger distinctions for cancers with large genomic amplifications or deletions, and address key questions regarding the relationship between cancer pathogenesis and epithelial cell polarity control in mammals.",

Subsequently, four more genes, also characterized as \"candidate\" tumor suppressor genes, were identified by homology search: ING2, ING3, ING4, and ING5. The ING proteins are characterized by a high homology in their C-terminal domain, which contains a Nuclear Localization Sequence and a Plant HomeoDomain (PHD), which has a high affinity to Histone 3 tri-methylated on lysine 4 (H3K4Me3). The ING proteins have been involved in the control of cell growth, senescence, apoptosis, chromatin remodeling, and DNA repair. Within the ING family, ING1 and ING2 form a subgroup since they are evolutionarily and functionally close. In yeast, only one gene, Pho23, is related to ING1 and ING2 and possesses also a PHD. Recently, the ING1 and ING2 tumor suppressor status has been fully established since several studies have described the loss of ING1 and ING2 protein expression in human tumors and both ING1 and ING2 knockout mice were reported to have spontaneously developed tumors, B cell lymphomas, and soft tissue sarcomas, respectively. In this review, we will describe for the first time what is known about the ING1 and ING2 genes, proteins, their regulations in both human and mice, and their status in human tumors. Furthermore, we explore the current knowledge about identified functions involving ING1 and ING2 in tumor suppression pathways especially in the control of cell cycle and in genome stability.",

			"abstract": "Substantial advances have been made in understanding critical molecular and cellular mechanisms driving tumor initiation, maintenance, and progression in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Over the last decade, these findings have led to the discovery of a variety of novel drug targets and the development of new treatment strategies. Already, the standard of care for patients with advanced-stage NSCLC is shifting from selecting therapy empirically based on a patient's clinicopathologic features to using biomarker-driven treatment algorithms based on the molecular profile of a patient's tumor. This approach is currently best exemplified by treating patients with NSCLC with first-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors when their cancers harbor gain-of-function hotspot mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements. These genotype-based targeted therapies represent the first step toward personalizing NSCLC therapy. Recent technology advances in multiplex genotyping and high-throughput genomic profiling by next-generation sequencing technologies now offer the possibility of rapidly and comprehensively interrogating the cancer genome of individual patients from small tumor biopsies. This advance provides the basis for categorizing molecular-defined subsets of patients with NSCLC in whom a growing list of novel molecularly targeted therapeutics are clinically evaluable and additional novel drug targets can be discovered. Increasingly, practicing oncologists are facing the challenge of determining how to select, interpret, and apply these new genetic and genomic assays. This review summarizes the evolution, early success, current status, challenges, and opportunities for clinical application of genotyping and genomic tests in therapeutic decision making for NSCLC.",

			"abstract": "The concept of synthetic lethality has gained popularity as a rational guide for predicting chemotherapeutic targets based on negative genetic interactions between tumor-specific somatic mutations and a second-site target gene. One hallmark of most cancers that can be exploited by chemotherapies is chromosome instability (CIN). Because chromosome replication, maintenance, and segregation represent conserved and cell-essential processes, they can be modeled effectively in simpler eukaryotes such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we analyze and extend genetic networks of CIN cancer gene orthologs in yeast, focusing on essential genes. This identifies hub genes and processes that are candidate targets for synthetic lethal killing of cancer cells with defined somatic mutations. One hub process in these networks is DNA replication. A nonessential, fork-associated scaffold, CTF4, is among the most highly connected genes. As Ctf4 lacks enzymatic activity, potentially limiting its development as a therapeutic target, we exploited its function as a physical interaction hub to rationally predict synthetic lethal interactions between essential Ctf4-binding proteins and CIN cancer gene orthologs. We then validated a subset of predicted genetic interactions in a human colorectal cancer cell line, showing that siRNA-mediated knockdown of MRE11A sensitizes cells to depletion of various replication fork-associated proteins. Overall, this work describes methods to identify, predict, and validate in cancer cells candidate therapeutic targets for tumors with known somatic mutations in CIN genes using data from yeast. We affirm not only replication stress but also the targeting of DNA replication fork proteins themselves as potential targets for anticancer therapeutic development.",

Tumor-specific chromosomal translocations, characteristic findings in several human malignancies that directly lead to malignant transformation, have not been identified in CLL. Using paired-end transcriptome sequencing, we identified recurrent and reciprocal RNA chimeras involving yippee like 5 (YPEL5) and serine/threonine-protein phosphatase PP1-beta-catalytic subunit (PPP1CB) in CLL. Two of seven index cases (28%) harbored the reciprocal RNA chimeras in our initial screening. Using quantitative real-time PCR (q real-time PCR), YPEL5/PPP1CB and PPP1CB/YPEL5 fusion transcripts were detected in 97 of 103 CLL samples (95%) but not in paired normal samples, benign lymphocytes, or various unrelated cancers. Whole-genome sequencing and Southern blotting demonstrated no evidence for a genomic fusion between YPEL5 and PPP1CB. YPEL5/PPP1CB chimera, when introduced into mammalian cells, expressed a truncated PPP1CB protein that demonstrated diminished phosphatase activity. PPP1CB silencing resulted in enhanced proliferation and colony formation of MEC1 and JVM3 cells, implying a role in the pathogenesis of mature B-cell leukemia.

The model makes the prediction, validated by our empirical findings, that the number of somatic mutations in tumors of self-renewing tissues is positively correlated with the age of the patient at diagnosis. Importantly, our analysis indicates that half or more of the somatic mutations in certain tumors of self-renewing tissues occur before the onset of neoplasia.

			"abstract": "Germ-line mutation rate has been regarded classically as a fundamental biological parameter, as it affects the prevalence of genetic disorders and the rate of evolution. Somatic mutation rate is also an important biological parameter, as it may influence the development and/or the course of acquired diseases, particularly of cancer. Estimates of this parameter have been previously obtained in few instances from dermal fibroblasts and lymphoblastoid cells. However, the methodology required has been laborious and did not lend itself to the analysis of large numbers of samples. We have previously shown that the X-linked gene PIG-A, since its product is required for glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins to become surface bound, is a good sentinel gene for studying somatic mutations. We now show that by this approach we can accurately measure the proportion of PIG-A mutant peripheral blood granulocytes, which we call mutant frequency, \u0192. We found that the results are reproducible, with a variation coefficient (CV) of 45%. Repeat samples from 32 subjects also had a CV of 44%, indicating that \u0192 is a relatively stable individual characteristic. From a study of 142 normal subjects we found that log \u0192 is a normally distributed variable; \u0192 variability spans a 80-fold range, from less than 1\u00d710\u207b\u2076 to 37.5\u00d710\u207b\u2076, with a median of 4.9\u00d710\u207b\u2076. Unlike other techniques commonly employed in population studies, such as comet assay, this method can detect any kind of mutation, including point mutation, as long as it causes functional inactivation of PIG-A gene. Since the test is rapid and requires only a small sample of peripheral blood, this methodology will lend itself to investigating genetic factors that underlie the variation in the somatic mutation rate, as well as environmental factors that may affect it. It will be also possible to test whether \u0192 is a determinant of the risk of cancer.",

			"abstract": "Carcinogenesis is thought to occur through a combination of mutational and epimutational events that disrupt key pathways regulating cellular growth and division. The DNA methylomes of cancer cells can exhibit two striking differences from normal cells; a global reduction of DNA methylation levels and the aberrant hypermethylation of some sequences, particularly CpG islands (CGIs). This aberrant hypermethylation is often invoked as a mechanism causing the transcriptional inactivation of tumour suppressor genes that directly drives the carcinogenic process. Here, we review our current understanding of this phenomenon, focusing on how global analysis of cancer methylomes indicates that most affected CGI genes are already silenced prior to aberrant hypermethylation during cancer development. We also discuss how genome-scale analyses of both normal and cancer cells have refined our understanding of the elusive mechanism(s) that may underpin aberrant CGI hypermethylation.",

Remarkably, these mutational processes are poorly characterized. Global sequencing initiatives are yielding catalogs of somatic mutations from thousands of cancers, thus providing the unique opportunity to decipher the signatures of mutational processes operative in human cancer. However, until now there have been no theoretical models describing the signatures of mutational processes operative in cancer genomes and no systematic computational approaches are available to decipher these mutational signatures. Here, by modeling mutational processes as a blind source separation problem, we introduce a computational framework that effectively addresses these questions.

However, these systems are characterized by recurring integrations that accumulate in tumor cells and that hamper the identification of early cancer-driving events among bystander and progression-related events. We developed an insertional mutagenesis platform based on lentiviral vectors (LVVs) by which we could efficiently induce hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in three different mouse models. By virtue of the LVV's replication-deficient nature and broad genome-wide integration pattern, LVV-based insertional mutagenesis allowed identification of four previously unknown liver cancer-associated genes from a limited number of integrations. We validated the oncogenic potential of all the identified genes in vivo, with different levels of penetrance. The newly identified genes are likely to play a role in human cancer because they are upregulated, amplified and/or deleted in human HCCs and can predict clinical outcomes of patients.",

Chromosome-scale mutations occur at rates orders of magnitude higher than base substitutions, yet our understanding of the mechanisms leading to CNVs has been lagging. We examined CNV in a region of chromosome 5 (chr5) in haploid and diploid strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We optimized a CNV detection assay based on a reporter cassette containing the SFA1 and CUP1 genes that confer gene dosage-dependent tolerance to formaldehyde and copper, respectively. This optimized reporter allowed the selection of low-order gene amplification events, going from one copy to two copies in haploids and from two to three copies in diploids. In haploid strains, most events involved tandem segmental duplications mediated by nonallelic homologous recombination between flanking direct repeats, primarily Ty1 elements. In diploids, most events involved the formation of a recurrent nonreciprocal translocation between a chr5 Ty1 element and another Ty1 repeat on chr13. In addition to amplification events, a subset of clones displaying elevated resistance to formaldehyde had point mutations within the SFA1 coding sequence. These mutations were all dominant and are proposed to result in hyperactive forms of the formaldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme.",

Using data from 86 paired normal and primary tumor samples, we identified losses and gains of complete chromosomes or large genomic regions, as well as smaller regions affecting a minimum of one gene. Comparison with high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) arrays revealed a high sensitivity and a low number of false positives in the copy number estimation between both approaches. We explore the main factors affecting sensitivity and false positives with real data, and provide a side by side comparison with CGH arrays. Together, these results underscore the utility of exome sequencing to study cancer samples by allowing not only the identification of substitutions and indels, but also the accurate estimation of copy number alterations.",

The finding of this phenomenon, termed the \"Warburg effect,\" stimulated much research on tumorigenesis, but few explanations were forthcoming to explain the observation. Recently, advanced developments in molecular biology and high-throughput molecular analyses have revealed that many of the signaling pathways altered by gene mutations regulate cell metabolism in cancer. Furthermore, mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 were shown to elevate 2-hydroxyglutarate, which led to changes in \u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase enzyme activity, resulting in an increased risk of malignant tumors. Although these findings led to a renewed interest in cancer metabolism, our knowledge on the specifics of tumor metabolism is still fragmented.

The founding member, GPN1/NPA3/XAB1, is proposed to function in nuclear import of RNA polymerase II along with a recently described protein called Iwr1. Here we show that the previously uncharacterized protein Gpn2 binds both Gpn3 and Npa3/Gpn1 and that temperature-sensitive alleles of Saccharomyces cerevisiae GPN2 and GPN3 exhibit genetic interactions with RNA polymerase II mutants, hypersensitivity to transcription inhibition, and defects in RNA polymerase II nuclear localization. Importantly, we identify previously unrecognized RNA polymerase III localization defects in GPN2, GPN3, and IWR1 mutant backgrounds but find no localization defects of unrelated nuclear proteins or of RNA polymerase I. Previously, it was unclear whether the GPN proteins and Iwr1 had overlapping function in RNA polymerase II assembly or import. In this study, we show that the nuclear import defect of iwr1\u0394, but not the GPN2 or GPN3 mutant defects, is partially suppressed by fusion of a nuclear localization signal to the RNA polymerase II subunit Rpb3. These data, combined with strong genetic interactions between GPN2 and IWR1, suggest that the GPN proteins function upstream of Iwr1 in RNA polymerase II and III biogenesis. We propose that the three GPN proteins execute a common, and likely essential, function in RNA polymerase assembly and transport.",

			"abstract": "Cancer cells deviate from normal body cells in two immunologically important ways. First, tumour cells carry tens to hundreds of protein-changing mutations that are either responsible for cellular transformation or that have accumulated as mere passengers. Second, as a consequence of genetic and epigenetic alterations, tumour cells express a series of proteins that are normally not present or present at lower levels. These changes lead to the presentation of an altered repertoire of MHC class I-associated peptides. Importantly, while there is now strong clinical evidence that cytotoxic T-cell activity against such tumour-associated antigens can lead to cancer regression, at present we fail to understand which tumour-associated antigens form the prime targets in effective immunotherapies. Here, we describe how recent developments in cancer genomics will make it feasible to establish the repertoire of tumour-associated epitopes on a patient-specific basis. The elucidation of this 'cancer antigenome' will be valuable to reveal how clinically successful immunotherapies mediate their effect. Furthermore, the description of the cancer antigenome should form the basis of novel forms of personalized cancer immunotherapy.",

			"abstract": "Semaphorin signaling through Plexin frequently participates in tumorigenesis and malignant progression in various types of cancer. In particular, the role of semaphorin signaling in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains unexplored, despite a high likelihood of metastasis and mortality. Unlike other epithelial malignancies that often express a small number of specific genes in the Semaphorin/Plexin family, five or more are often expressed in human PDAC. Such concomitant expression of these SEMA3/Plexin family members is not a result of gene amplification, but (at least partially) from increased gene transcription activated by SOX4 de novo expressed in PDAC. Via chromatin-immunoprecipitation, luciferase promoter activity assay and electrophoresis mobility shift assay, SOX4 is demonstrated to bind to the consensus site at the promoter of each SEMA3 and Plexin gene to enhance transcription activity. Conversely, RNAi-knockdown of SOX4 in PDAC cell lines results in decreased expression of SEMA3/Plexin family members and is associated with restricted tumor growth both in vitro and in SCID mice. We further demonstrate that SOX4 levels parallel with the summed expression of SEMA3/Plexin family members (P = 0.033, NPar Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis), which also correlates with poor survival in human PDAC (P = 0.0409, Kaplan-Meier analysis). Intriguingly, miR-129-2 and miR-335, both of which target SOX4 for degradation, are co-repressed in human PDAC cases associated with up-regulated SOX4 in a statistically significant way. In conclusion, we disclose a miR-129-2(miR-335)/SOX4/Semaphorin-Plexin regulatory axis in the tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancer.",

In this review, we focus on the known and potential roles of somatic mutagenesis in SLE. We will argue that anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) arise predominantly from nonautoreactive B cells that are transformed into autoreactive cells by the process of somatic hypermutation (SHM), which is normally associated with affinity maturation during the germinal center reaction. We will also discuss the role of SHM in creating antigenic peptides in the V region of the B cell receptor (BCR) and its potential to open an avenue of unregulated T cell help to autoreactive B cells. Finally, we will end this review with new experimental evidence suggesting that spontaneous somatic mutagenesis of genes that regulate B cell survival and activation is a rate-limiting causative factor in the development of ANA.",

			"abstract": "BCR-ABL1 compound mutations can confer high-level resistance to imatinib and other ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The third-generation ABL1 TKI ponatinib is effective against BCR-ABL1 point mutants individually, but remains vulnerable to certain BCR-ABL1 compound mutants. To determine the frequency of compound mutations among chronic myeloid leukemia patients on ABL1 TKI therapy, in the present study, we examined a collection of patient samples (N = 47) with clear evidence of 2 BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations by direct sequencing. Using a cloning and sequencing method, we found that 70% (33/47) of double mutations detected by direct sequencing were compound mutations. Sequential, branching, and parallel routes to compound mutations were common. In addition, our approach revealed individual and compound mutations not detectable by direct sequencing. The frequency of clones harboring compound mutations with more than 2 missense mutations was low (10%), whereas the likelihood of silent mutations increased disproportionately with the total number of mutations per clone, suggesting a limited tolerance for BCR-ABL1 kinase domain missense mutations. We conclude that compound mutations are common in patients with sequencing evidence for 2 BCR-ABL1 mutations and frequently reflect a highly complex clonal network, the evolution of which may be limited by the negative impact of missense mutations on kinase function.",

			"abstract": "Atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) shares clinical and laboratory features with CML, but it lacks the BCR-ABL1 fusion. We performed exome sequencing of eight aCMLs and identified somatic alterations of SETBP1 (encoding a p.Gly870Ser alteration) in two cases. Targeted resequencing of 70 aCMLs, 574 diverse hematological malignancies and 344 cancer cell lines identified SETBP1 mutations in 24 cases, including 17 of 70 aCMLs (24.3%; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 16-35%). Most mutations (92%) were located between codons 858 and 871 and were identical to changes seen in individuals with Schinzel-Giedion syndrome. Individuals with mutations had higher white blood cell counts (P = 0.008) and worse prognosis (P = 0.01). The p.Gly870Ser alteration abrogated a site for ubiquitination, and cells exogenously expressing this mutant exhibited higher amounts of SETBP1 and SET protein, lower PP2A activity and higher proliferation rates relative to those expressing the wild-type protein. In summary, mutated SETBP1 represents a newly discovered oncogene present in aCML and closely related diseases.",

			"abstract": "The theory of the clonal origin of cancer states that a tumour arises from one cell that acquires mutation(s) leading to the malignant phenotype. It is the current belief that many of these mutations give a fitness advantage to the mutant population allowing it to expand, eventually leading to disease. However, mutations that lead to such a clonal expansion need not give a fitness advantage and may in fact be neutral--or almost neutral--with respect to fitness. Such mutant clones can be eliminated or expand stochastically, leading to a malignant phenotype (disease). Mutations in haematopoietic stem cells give rise to diseases such as chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH). Although neutral drift often leads to clonal extinction, disease is still possible, and in this case, it has important implications both for the incidence of disease and for therapy, as it may be more difficult to eliminate neutral mutations with therapy. We illustrate the consequences of such dynamics, using CML and PNH as examples. These considerations have implications for many other tumours as well.",

A recent crop of discoveries have highlighted the medical impact of NGS technologies on Mendelian and complex diseases, particularly cancer. However, the ever-increasing pace of NGS adoption presents enormous challenges in terms of data processing, storage, management and interpretation as well as sequencing quality control, which hinder the translation from sequence data into clinical practice. In this review, we first summarize the technical characteristics and performance of current NGS platforms. We further highlight advances in the applications of NGS technologies towards the development of clinical diagnostics and therapeutics. Common issues in NGS workflows are also discussed to guide the selection of NGS platforms and pipelines for specific research purposes.",

This picture has changed with advances in the systematic annotation of functional noncoding elements. Evolutionary conservation, functional genomics, chromatin state, sequence motifs and molecular quantitative trait loci all provide complementary information about the function of noncoding sequences. These functional maps can help with prioritizing variants on risk haplotypes, filtering mutations encountered in the clinic and performing systems-level analyses to reveal processes underlying disease associations. Advances in predictive modeling can enable data-set integration to reveal pathways shared across loci and alleles, and richer regulatory models can guide the search for epistatic interactions. Lastly, new massively parallel reporter experiments can systematically validate regulatory predictions. Ultimately, advances in regulatory and systems genomics can help unleash the value of whole-genome sequencing for personalized genomic risk assessment, diagnosis and treatment.",

To enlarge the scope of CellLineNavigator, the database was furthermore closely linked to commonly used bioinformatics databases and knowledge repositories. To ensure easy data access and search ability, a simple data and an intuitive querying interface were implemented. It allows the user to explore and filter gene expression, focusing on pathological or physiological conditions. For a more complex search, the advanced query interface may be used to query for (i) differentially expressed genes; (ii) pathological or physiological conditions; or (iii) gene names or functional attributes, such as Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes pathway maps. These queries may also be combined. Finally, CellLineNavigator allows additional advanced analysis of differentially regulated genes by a direct link to the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) Bioinformatics Resources.",

It is, therefore, imperative to identify cancer-specific somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs), with respect to matched normal tissue, in order to understand their association with the disease. We have devised an accurate, sensitive, and easy-to-use tool, COPS, COpy number using Paired Samples, for detecting SCNAs. We rigorously tested the performance of COPS using short sequence simulated reads at various sizes and coverage of SCNAs, read depths, read lengths and also with real tumor:normal paired samples. We found COPS to perform better in comparison to other known SCNA detection tools for all evaluated parameters, namely, sensitivity (detection of true positives), specificity (detection of false positives) and size accuracy. COPS performed well for sequencing reads of all lengths when used with most upstream read alignment tools. Additionally, by incorporating a downstream boundary segmentation detection tool, the accuracy of SCNA boundaries was further improved. Here, we report an accurate, sensitive and easy to use tool in detecting cancer-specific SCNAs using short-read sequence data. In addition to cancer, COPS can be used for any disease as long as sequence reads from both disease and normal samples from the same individual are available. An added boundary segmentation detection module makes COPS detected SCNA boundaries more specific for the samples studied. COPS is available at ftp://115.119.160.213 with username \"cops\" and password \"cops\".",

However, the condensation state of chromatin is not the only barrier to DDR. In this review, we have collected data regarding the presence of DDR factors on micronuclear DNA lesions that indicate that micronuclei are almost incapable of generating an effective DDR because of defects in their nuclear envelope. Finally, considering the recent observations about the reincorporation of micronuclei to the main bulk of chromosomes, we suggest that, under certain circumstances, micronuclei carrying DNA damage might be a source of chromosome instability.",

			"abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide and shows a propensity to metastasize and infiltrate adjacent and more distant tissues. HCC is associated with multiple risk factors, including hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, which is especially prevalent in China. Here, we used exome sequencing to identify somatic mutations in ten HBV-positive individuals with HCC with portal vein tumor thromboses (PVTTs), intrahepatic metastases. Both C:G>A:T and T:A>A:T transversions were frequently found among the 331 non-silent mutations. Notably, ARID1A, which encodes a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, was mutated in 14 of 110 (13%) HBV-associated HCC specimens. We used RNA interference to assess the roles of 91 of the confirmed mutated genes in cellular survival. The results suggest that seven of these genes, including VCAM1 and CDK14, may confer growth and infiltration capacity to HCC cells. This study provides a view of the landscape of somatic mutations that may be implicated in advanced HCC.",

			"abstract": "Genomic changes frequently occur in cancer cells during tumorigenesis from normal cells. Using the Illumina Human NS-12 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip to screen for gene copy number changes in primary hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), we initially detected amplification of 35 genes from four genomic regions (1q21-41, 6p21.2-24.1, 7p13 and 8q13-23). By integrated screening of these genes for both DNA copy number and gene expression in HCC and colorectal cancer, we selected CENPF (centromere protein F/mitosin), GMNN (geminin, DNA replication inhibitor), CDK13 (cyclin-dependent kinase 13), and FAM82B (family with sequence similarity 82, member B) as common cancer genes. Each gene exhibited an amplification frequency of ~30% (range, 20-50%) in primary HCC (n = 57) and colorectal cancer (n = 12), as well as in a panel of human cancer cell lines (n = 70). Clonogenic and invasion assays of NIH3T3 cells transfected with each of the four amplified genes showed that CENPF, GMNN, and CDK13 were highly oncogenic whereas FAM82B was not. Interestingly, the oncogenic activity of these genes (excluding FAM82B) was highly correlated with gene-copy numbers in tumor samples (correlation coefficient, r>0.423), indicating that amplifications of CENPF, GMNN, and CDK13 genes are tightly linked and coincident in tumors. Furthermore, we confirmed that CDK13 gene copy number was significantly associated with clinical onset age in patients with HCC (P = 0.0037). Taken together, our results suggest that coincidently amplified CDK13, GMNN, and CENPF genes can play a role as common cancer-driver genes in human cancers.",

The International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) was formed to solve this fundamental issue by coordinating the sequencing of samples from 50 different cancer types and/or sub-types that are of clinical and societal importance. The contribution of Spain in this consortium has been focused on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This approach has unveiled new and unexpected events in the development of CLL. In this review, we introduce the approaches utilized by the consortium for the study of the CLL genome and discuss the recent results and future perspectives of this work.",

			"abstract": "Due to genome instability, most cancers exhibit loss of regions containing tumor suppressor genes and collateral loss of other genes. To identify cancer-specific vulnerabilities that are the result of copy number losses, we performed integrated analyses of genome-wide copy number and RNAi profiles and identified 56 genes for which gene suppression specifically inhibited the proliferation of cells harboring partial copy number loss of that gene. These CYCLOPS (copy number alterations yielding cancer liabilities owing to partial loss) genes are enriched for spliceosome, proteasome, and ribosome components. One CYCLOPS gene, PSMC2, encodes an essential member of the 19S proteasome. Normal cells express excess PSMC2, which resides in a complex with PSMC1, PSMD2, and PSMD5 and acts as a reservoir protecting cells from PSMC2 suppression. Cells harboring partial PSMC2 copy number loss lack this complex and die after PSMC2 suppression. These observations define a distinct class of cancer-specific liabilities resulting from genome instability.",

In the past few decades, tremendous progress has been achieved towards elucidating the mechanism causing chromosomal translocations. This review focuses on the basic mechanisms underlying the generation of chromosomal translocations.

The goal of personalized therapy is to target aberrations that drive tumour growth and survival, by administering the right drug combination for the right person. This is becoming increasingly achievable with advances in high-throughput technologies to characterize tumours and the expanding repertoire of molecularly targeted therapies. However, there are numerous challenges that need to be surpassed before delivering on the promise of personalized cancer therapy. These include tumour heterogeneity and molecular evolution, costs and potential morbidity of biopsies, lack of effective drugs against most genomic aberrations, technical limitations of molecular tests, and reimbursement and regulatory hurdles. Critically, the 'hype' surrounding personalized cancer therapy must be tempered with realistic expectations, which, today, encompass increased survival times for only a portion of patients.",

			"abstract": "Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer related morbidity and mortality globally, and carries a dismal prognosis. Improved understanding of the biology of cancer is required to improve patient outcomes. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful tool for whole genome characterisation, enabling comprehensive examination of somatic mutations that drive oncogenesis. Most NGS methods are based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of platform-specific DNA fragment libraries, which are then sequenced. These techniques are well suited to high-throughput sequencing and are able to detect the full spectrum of genomic changes present in cancer. However, they require considerable investments in time, laboratory infrastructure, computational analysis and bioinformatic support. Next-generation sequencing has been applied to studies of the whole genome, exome, transcriptome and epigenome, and is changing the paradigm of lung cancer research and patient care. The results of this new technology will transform current knowledge of oncogenic pathways and provide molecular targets of use in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Somatic mutations in lung cancer have already been identified by NGS, and large scale genomic studies are underway. Personalised treatment strategies will improve care for those likely to benefit from available therapies, while sparing others the expense and morbidity of futile intervention. Organisational, computational and bioinformatic challenges of NGS are driving technological advances as well as raising ethical issues relating to informed consent and data release. Differentiation between driver and passenger mutations requires careful interpretation of sequencing data. Challenges in the interpretation of results arise from the types of specimens used for DNA extraction, sample processing techniques and tumour content. Tumour heterogeneity can reduce power to detect mutations implicated in oncogenesis. Next-generation sequencing will facilitate investigation of the biological and clinical implications of such variation. These techniques can now be applied to single cells and free circulating DNA, and possibly in the future to DNA obtained from body fluids and from subpopulations of tumour. As costs reduce, and speed and processing accuracy increase, NGS technology will become increasingly accessible to researchers and clinicians, with the ultimate goal of improving the care of patients with lung cancer.",

To this end, we first developed a knowledge mining approach to identify functional expression modules; we then developed a graph-based data mining approach to identify mutations that are highly related to the functional modules, as a means to re-constitute signal pathways. Our results indicate that unification of knowledge mining with data mining significantly enhance identification of potential signaling pathways in ovarian cancers.",

			"abstract": "The availability of the human genome sequence has allowed identification of disease-causing mutations in many Mendelian disorders, and detection of significant associations of nucleotide polymorphisms to complex diseases and traits. Despite these progresses, finding the causative variations for most of the common diseases remains a complex task. Several studies have shown gene expression analyses provide a quite unbiased way to investigate complex traits and common disorders' pathogenesis. Therefore, whole-transcriptome analysis is increasingly acquiring a key role in the knowledge of mechanisms responsible for complex diseases. Hybridization- and tag-based technologies have elucidated the involvement of multiple genes and pathways in pathological conditions, providing insights into the expression of thousand of coding and noncoding RNAs, such as microRNAs. However, the introduction of Next-Generation Sequencing, particularly of RNA-Seq, has overcome some drawbacks of previously used technologies. Identifying, in a single experiment, potentially novel genes/exons and splice isoforms, RNA editing, fusion transcripts and allele-specific expression are some of its advantages. RNA-Seq has been fruitfully applied to study cancer and host-pathogens interactions, and it is taking first steps for studying neurodegenerative diseases (ND) as well as neuropsychiatric diseases. In addition, it is emerging as a very powerful tool to study quantitative trait loci associated with gene expression in complex diseases. This paper provides an overview on gene expression profiling of complex diseases, with emphasis on RNA-Seq, its advantages over conventional technologies for studying cancer and ND, and for linking nucleotide variations to gene expression changes, also discussing its limitations.",

			"abstract": "All cancers carry somatic mutations in their genomes. A subset, known as driver mutations, confer clonal selective advantage on cancer cells and are causally implicated in oncogenesis, and the remainder are passenger mutations. The driver mutations and mutational processes operative in breast cancer have not yet been comprehensively explored. Here we examine the genomes of 100 tumours for somatic copy number changes and mutations in the coding exons of protein-coding genes. The number of somatic mutations varied markedly between individual tumours. We found strong correlations between mutation number, age at which cancer was diagnosed and cancer histological grade, and observed multiple mutational signatures, including one present in about ten per cent of tumours characterized by numerous mutations of cytosine at TpC dinucleotides. Driver mutations were identified in several new cancer genes including AKT2, ARID1B, CASP8, CDKN1B, MAP3K1, MAP3K13, NCOR1, SMARCD1 and TBX3. Among the 100 tumours, we found driver mutations in at least 40 cancer genes and 73 different combinations of mutated cancer genes. The results highlight the substantial genetic diversity underlying this common disease.",

			"abstract": "With the growing availability of omics data generated to describe different cells and tissues, the modeling and interpretation of such data has become increasingly important. Pathways are sets of reactions involving genes, metabolites, and proteins highlighting functional modules in the cell. Therefore, to discover activated or perturbed pathways when comparing two conditions, for example two different tissues, it is beneficial to use several types of omics data. We present a model that integrates transcriptomic and metabolomic data in order to make an informed pathway-level decision. Since metabolites can be seen as end-points of perturbations happening at the gene level, the gene expression data constitute the explanatory variables in a sparse regression model for the metabolite data. Sophisticated model selection procedures are developed to determine an appropriate model. We demonstrate that the transcript profiles can be used to informatively explain the metabolite data from cancer cell lines. Simulation studies further show that the proposed model offers a better performance in identifying active pathways than, for example, enrichment methods performed separately on the transcript and metabolite data.",

			"abstract": "Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and copy number alteration (CNA) feature prominently in the somatic genomic landscape of tumors. As such, karyotypic aberrations in cancer genomes have been studied extensively to discover novel oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes. Advances in sequencing technology have enabled the cost-effective detection of tumor genome and transcriptome mutation events at single-base-pair resolution; however, computational methods for predicting segmental regions of LOH in this context are not yet fully explored. Consequently, whole transcriptome, nucleotide-level resolution analysis of monoallelic expression patterns associated with LOH has not yet been undertaken in cancer. We developed a novel approach for inference of LOH from paired tumor/normal sequence data and applied it to a cohort of 23 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) genomes. Following extensive benchmarking experiments, we describe the nucleotide-resolution landscape of LOH in TNBC and assess the consequent effect of LOH on the transcriptomes of these tumors using RNA-seq-derived measurements of allele-specific expression. We show that the majority of monoallelic expression in the transcriptomes of triple-negative breast cancer can be explained by genomic regions of LOH and establish an upper bound for monoallelic expression that may be explained by other tumor-specific modifications such as epigenetics or mutations. Monoallelically expressed genes associated with LOH reveal that cell cycle, homologous recombination and actin-cytoskeletal functions are putatively disrupted by LOH in TNBC. Finally, we show how inference of LOH can be used to interpret allele frequencies of somatic mutations and postulate on temporal ordering of mutations in the evolutionary history of these tumors.",

This analysis identified glycine consumption and expression of the mitochondrial glycine biosynthetic pathway as strongly correlated with rates of proliferation across cancer cells. Antagonizing glycine uptake and its mitochondrial biosynthesis preferentially impaired rapidly proliferating cells. Moreover, higher expression of this pathway was associated with greater mortality in breast cancer patients.

The patterns of mutation in cancer genomes reflect the DNA damage and repair processes to which cancer cells and their precursors have been exposed. To explore these mechanisms further, we generated catalogs of somatic mutation from 21 breast cancers and applied mathematical methods to extract mutational signatures of the underlying processes. Multiple distinct single- and double-nucleotide substitution signatures were discernible. Cancers with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations exhibited a characteristic combination of substitution mutation signatures and a distinctive profile of deletions. Complex relationships between somatic mutation prevalence and transcription were detected. A remarkable phenomenon of localized hypermutation, termed \"kataegis,\" was observed. Regions of kataegis differed between cancers but usually colocalized with somatic rearrangements. Base substitutions in these regions were almost exclusively of cytosine at TpC dinucleotides. The mechanisms underlying most of these mutational signatures are unknown. However, a role for the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases is proposed.",

These processes mark the genome, such that a cancer's life history is encrypted in the somatic mutations present. We developed algorithms to decipher this narrative and applied them to 21 breast cancers. Mutational processes evolve across a cancer's lifespan, with many emerging late but contributing extensive genetic variation. Subclonal diversification is prominent, and most mutations are found in just a fraction of tumor cells. Every tumor has a dominant subclonal lineage, representing more than 50% of tumor cells. Minimal expansion of these subclones occurs until many hundreds to thousands of mutations have accumulated, implying the existence of long-lived, quiescent cell lineages capable of substantial proliferation upon acquisition of enabling genomic changes. Expansion of the dominant subclone to an appreciable mass may therefore represent the final rate-limiting step in a breast cancer's development, triggering diagnosis.",

To address this challenge, we utilized a targeted, massively parallel sequencing approach to detect tumor genomic alterations in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples. Nearly 400-fold mean sequence coverage was achieved, and single-nucleotide sequence variants, small insertions/deletions, and chromosomal copynumber alterations were detected simultaneously with high accuracy compared with other methods in clinical use. Putatively actionable genomic alterations, including those that predict sensitivity or resistance to established and experimental therapies, were detected in each tumor sample tested. Thus, targeted deep sequencing of clinical tumor material may enable mutation-driven clinical trials and, ultimately, \"personalized\" cancer treatment.",

More sophisticated mouse models were subsequently developed to delete a gene in a specific cell type at a specific time point. Additionally, incorporation of point mutations in a specific gene as observed in human tumors has also revealed their contributions to tumorigenesis. On the other hand, some models never develop cancer unless combined with other deletions suggesting a modifying role in tumorigenesis.

On the other hand, more sensitive molecular-based detection methods like next generation sequencing, microarray, and many others are capable of providing faster results. DNA testing is now possible on a single molecule, and high-throughput analysis allows multiple detection reactions to be performed at once, thus allowing a range of characteristics to be rapidly and simultaneously determined.

We show in a rigorous experimental assessment that our approach is capable of detecting variants with frequencies as low as 1/10,000 alleles. In selected genomic loci of the TP53 and VHL genes isolated from matched tumour and normal samples of four renal cell carcinoma patients, we detect 24 variants at allele frequencies ranging from 0.0002 to 0.34.

Results can be highly data type dependent, restricting the ability to discover new insights from multidimensional data. In this study, we present an integrative subtype analysis of the TCGA glioblastoma (GBM) data set. Our analysis revealed new insights through integrated subtype characterization. We found three distinct integrated tumor subtypes. Subtype 1 lacks the classical GBM events of chr 7 gain and chr 10 loss. This subclass is enriched for the G-CIMP phenotype and shows hypermethylation of genes involved in brain development and neuronal differentiation. The tumors in this subclass display a Proneural expression profile. Subtype 2 is characterized by a near complete association with EGFR amplification, overrepresentation of promoter methylation of homeobox and G-protein signaling genes, and a Classical expression profile. Subtype 3 is characterized by NF1 and PTEN alterations and exhibits a Mesenchymal-like expression profile. The data analysis workflow we propose provides a unified and computationally scalable framework to harness the full potential of large-scale integrated cancer genomic data for integrative subtype discovery.",

			"abstract": "Apoptosis serves as a protective mechanism by eliminating damaged cells through programmed cell death. After apoptotic cells pass critical checkpoints, including mitochondrial fragmentation, executioner caspase activation, and DNA damage, it is assumed that cell death inevitably follows. However, this assumption has not been tested directly. Here we report an unexpected reversal of late-stage apoptosis in primary liver and heart cells, macrophages, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, cervical cancer HeLa cells, and brain cells. After exposure to an inducer of apoptosis, cells exhibited multiple morphological and biochemical hallmarks of late-stage apoptosis, including mitochondrial fragmentation, caspase-3 activation, and DNA damage. Surprisingly, the vast majority of dying cells arrested the apoptotic process and recovered when the inducer was washed away. Of importance, some cells acquired permanent genetic changes and underwent oncogenic transformation at a higher frequency than controls. Global gene expression analysis identified a molecular signature of the reversal process. We propose that reversal of apoptosis is an unanticipated mechanism to rescue cells from crisis and propose to name this mechanism \"anastasis\" (Greek for \"rising to life\"). Whereas carcinogenesis represents a harmful side effect, potential benefits of anastasis could include preservation of cells that are difficult to replace and stress-induced genetic diversity.",

			"abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) results from a multistep process. This process includes initiation, which occurs through various aging events and multiple insults (such as chronic infection, inflammation and genetic instability through reactive oxygen species causing DNA double-strand breaks), followed by a multistep process of progression. These steps include several genetic and epigenetic alterations, as well as alterations to the chromatin structure, which occur in response to the carcinogenic stress-related events that sustain proliferative signaling. Events such as evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis are readily observed. In addition, in conjunction with these critical drivers of carcinogenesis, other factors related to the etiopathogenesis of PCa, involving energy metabolism and evasion of the immune surveillance system, appear to be involved. In addition, when cancer spread and metastasis occur, the 'tumor microenvironment' in the bone of PCa patients may provide a way to sustain dormancy or senescence and eventually establish a 'seed and soil' site where PCa proliferation and growth may occur over time. When PCa is initiated and progression ensues, significant alterations in nuclear size, shape and heterochromatin (DNA transcription) organization are found, and key nuclear transcriptional and structural proteins, as well as multiple nuclear bodies can lead to precancerous and malignant changes. These series of cellular and tissue-related malignancy-associated events can be quantified to assess disease progression and management.",

Repetitive sequences can be beneficial by serving specific cellular functions (e.g. centromeric and telomeric DNA) and by providing a rapid means for adaptive evolution. However, such elements are also substrates for deleterious chromosomal rearrangements that affect fitness and promote human disease. Recent studies analyzing the role of nuclear organization in DNA repair and factors that suppress non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) have provided insights into how genome stability is maintained in eukaryotes. In this review, we outline the types of repetitive sequences seen in eukaryotic genomes and how recombination mechanisms are regulated at the DNA sequence, cell organization, chromatin structure, and cell cycle control levels to prevent chromosomal rearrangements involving these sequences.",

			"abstract": "Cancer-associated mutations in cancer genes constitute a diverse set of mutations associated with the disease. To gain insight into features of the set, substitution, deletion and insertion mutations were analysed at the nucleotide level, from the COSMIC database. The most frequent substitutions were c \u2192 t, g \u2192 a, g \u2192 t, and the most frequent codon changes were to termination codons. Deletions more than insertions, FS (frameshift) indels more than I-F (in-frame) ones, and single-nucleotide indels, were frequent. FS indels cause loss of significant fractions of proteins. The 5'-cut in FS deletions, and 5'-ligation in FS insertions, often occur between pairs of identical bases. Interestingly, the cut-site and 3'-ligation in insertions, and 3'-cut and join-pair in deletions, were each found to be the same significantly often (p < 0.001). It is suggested that these features aid the incorporation of indel mutations. Tumor suppressors undergo larger numbers of mutations, especially disruptive ones, over the entire protein length, to inactivate two alleles. Proto-oncogenes undergo fewer, less-disruptive mutations, in selected protein regions, to activate a single allele. Finally, catalogues, in ranked order, of genes mutated in each cancer, and cancers in which each gene is mutated, were created. The study highlights the nucleotide level preferences and disruptive nature of cancer mutations.",

Cancer cells driven by mutant KRAS require expression of the serine/threonine kinase STK33 for their viability and proliferation, identifying STK33 as a context-dependent therapeutic target. However, specific strategies for interfering with the critical functions of STK33 are not yet available. Here, using a mass spectrometry-based screen for STK33 protein interaction partners, we report that the HSP90/CDC37 chaperone complex binds to and stabilizes STK33 in human cancer cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of HSP90, using structurally divergent small molecules currently in clinical development, induced proteasome-mediated degradation of STK33 in human cancer cells of various tissue origin in vitro and in vivo, and triggered apoptosis preferentially in KRAS mutant cells in an STK33-dependent manner. Furthermore, HSP90 inhibitor treatment impaired sphere formation and viability of primary human colon tumor-initiating cells harboring mutant KRAS. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the activity of HSP90 inhibitors in KRAS mutant cancer cells, indicate that the enhanced requirement for STK33 can be exploited to target mutant KRAS-driven tumors, and identify STK33 depletion through HSP90 inhibition as a biomarker-guided therapeutic strategy with immediate translational potential.",

Recently, analysis of 13,023 genes in breast and colorectal cancers identified OBSCN as one of the most frequently mutated genes, implicating it in cancer formation. Herein we studied the expression profile of obscurins in breast, colon, and skin cancer cell lines and their involvement in cell survival. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated significant reduction of obscurin proteins [corrected] in cancer cells, resulting from decreased mRNA levels and/or the presence of mutant transcripts. In normal epithelium, obscurins localize in cytoplasmic puncta, the cell membrane, and the nucleus. Accordingly, subcellular fractionation demonstrated the presence of 2 novel nuclear isoforms of \u223c110 and \u223c120 kDa. Nontumorigenic MCF10A breast epithelial cells stably transduced with shRNAs targeting giant obscurins exhibited increased viability (\u223c30%) and reduced apoptosis (\u223c20%) following exposure to the DNA-damaging agent etoposide. Quantitative RT-PCR further indicated that the antiapoptotic genes BAG4 and HAX1 were up-regulated (1.5- and 1.4-fold, respectively), whereas initiator caspase-9 and death caspase-3 transcripts were down-regulated (0.8- and 0.6-fold, respectively). Our findings are the first to pinpoint critical roles for obscurins in cancer development by contributing to the regulation of cell survival.",

Furthermore, because we have limited information on the prevalence and nature of ubiquitous molecular events that occur in neoplasms, it is unfeasible to implement molecular-targeted cancer screening and prevention. Here, we found that the FEAT protein is overexpressed in most human cancers, but weakly expressed in normal tissues including the testis, brain, and liver. Transgenic mice that ectopically expressed FEAT in the thymus, spleen, liver, and lung spontaneously developed invasive malignant lymphoma (48%, 19/40) and lung-metastasizing liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) (35%, 14/40) that models human hepatocarcinogenesis, indicating the FEAT protein potently drives tumorigenesis in vivo. Gene expression profiling suggested that FEAT drives receptor tyrosine kinase and hedgehog signalling pathways. These findings demonstrate that integrated efforts to identify FEAT-like ubiquitous oncoproteins are useful and may provide promising approaches for cost-effective cancer screening and prevention.",

			"abstract": "In large part, cancer results from the accumulation of multiple mutations in a single cell lineage that are sequentially acquired and subject to an evolutionary process where selection drives the expansion of more fit subclones. Owing to the technical challenge of distinguishing and isolating distinct cancer subclones, many aspects of this clonal evolution are poorly understood, including the diversity of different subclones in an individual cancer, the nature of the subclones contributing to relapse, and the identity of pre-cancerous mutations. These issues are not just important to our understanding of cancer biology, but are also clinically important given the need to understand the nature of subclones responsible for the refractory and relapsed disease that cause significant morbidity and mortality in patients. Recently, advanced genomic techniques have been used to investigate clonal diversity and evolution in acute leukemia. Studies of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) demonstrated that in individual patients there are multiple genetic subclones of leukemia-initiating cells, with a complex clonal architecture. Separate studies also investigating pediatric ALL determined that the clonal basis of relapse was variable and complex, with relapse often evolving from a clone ancestral to the predominant de novo leukemia clone. Additional studies in both ALL and acute myeloid leukemia have identified pre-leukemic mutations in some individual cases. This review will highlight these recent reports investigating the clonal evolution of acute leukemia genomes and discuss the implications for clinical therapy.",

Constitutive telomerase deficiency and associated telomere dysfunction constrained cancer progression. In contrast, telomerase reactivation in the setting of telomere dysfunction alleviated intratumoral DNA-damage signaling and generated aggressive cancers with rearranged genomes and new tumor biological properties (bone metastases). Comparative oncogenomic analysis revealed numerous recurrent amplifications and deletions of relevance to human prostate cancer. Murine tumors show enrichment of the TGF-\u03b2/SMAD4 network, and genetic validation studies confirmed the cooperative roles of Pten, p53, and Smad4 deficiencies in prostate cancer progression, including skeletal metastases. Thus, telomerase reactivation in tumor cells experiencing telomere dysfunction enables full malignant progression and provides a mechanism for acquisition of cancer-relevant genomic events endowing new tumor biological capabilities.",

			"abstract": "Quantitative analyses of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, such as the detection of copy number variations (CNVs), remain challenging. Current methods detect CNVs as changes in the depth of coverage along chromosomes. Technological or genomic variations in the depth of coverage thus lead to a high false discovery rate (FDR), even upon correction for GC content. In the context of association studies between CNVs and disease, a high FDR means many false CNVs, thereby decreasing the discovery power of the study after correction for multiple testing. We propose 'Copy Number estimation by a Mixture Of PoissonS' (cn.MOPS), a data processing pipeline for CNV detection in NGS data. In contrast to previous approaches, cn.MOPS incorporates modeling of depths of coverage across samples at each genomic position. Therefore, cn.MOPS is not affected by read count variations along chromosomes. Using a Bayesian approach, cn.MOPS decomposes variations in the depth of coverage across samples into integer copy numbers and noise by means of its mixture components and Poisson distributions, respectively. The noise estimate allows for reducing the FDR by filtering out detections having high noise that are likely to be false detections. We compared cn.MOPS with the five most popular methods for CNV detection in NGS data using four benchmark datasets: (i) simulated data, (ii) NGS data from a male HapMap individual with implanted CNVs from the X chromosome, (iii) data from HapMap individuals with known CNVs, (iv) high coverage data from the 1000 Genomes Project. cn.MOPS outperformed its five competitors in terms of precision (1-FDR) and recall for both gains and losses in all benchmark data sets. The software cn.MOPS is publicly available as an R package at http://www.bioinf.jku.at/software/cnmops/ and at Bioconductor.",

			"abstract": "The goal of sequencing the entire human genome for $1000 is almost in sight. However, the total costs including DNA sequencing, data management, and analysis to yield a clear data interpretation are unlikely to be lowered significantly any time soon to make studies on a population scale and daily clinical uses feasible. Alternatively, the targeted enrichment of specific groups of disease and biological pathway-focused genes and the capture of up to an entire human exome (~1% of the genome) allowing an unbiased investigation of the complete protein-coding regions in the genome are now routine. Targeted gene capture followed by sequencing with massively parallel next-generation sequencing (NGS) has the advantages of 1) significant cost saving, 2) higher sequencing accuracy because of deeper achievable coverage, 3) a significantly shorter turnaround time, and 4) a more feasible data set for a bioinformatic analysis outcome that is functionally interpretable. Gene capture combined with NGS has allowed a much greater number of samples to be examined than is currently practical with whole-genome sequencing. Such an approach promises to bring a paradigm shift to biomedical research of Mendelian disorders and their clinical diagnoses, ultimately enabling personalized medicine based on one's genetic profile. In this review, we describe major methodologies currently used for gene capture and detection of genetic variations by NGS. We will highlight applications of this technology in studies of genetic disorders and discuss issues pertaining to applications of this powerful technology in genetic screening and the discovery of genes implicated in syndromic and non-syndromic hearing loss.",

Functional analyses of primary samples face at least 3 major challenges: limited availability of primary samples for testing, paucity of functional information extracted from samples, and lack of functional methods accessible to many researchers. We developed a microscale cell culture platform that overcomes these limitations, especially for hematologic cancers. A key feature of the platform is the ability to compartmentalize small populations of adherent and nonadherent cells in controlled microenvironments that can better reflect physiological conditions and enable cell-cell interaction studies. Custom image analysis was developed to measure cell viability and protein subcellular localizations in single cells to provide insights into heterogeneity of cellular responses. We validated our platform by assessing viability and nuclear translocations of NF-\u03baB and STAT3 in multiple myeloma cells exposed to different conditions, including cocultured bone marrow stromal cells. We further assessed its utility by analyzing NF-\u03baB activation in a primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient sample.

Subsequent copy number calling is based on the integration of BAC probe-specific copy number probabilities that are estimated by comparing probe intensities with a single-cell whole-genome amplification (WGA) reference model for diploid chromosomes, as well as SNP copy number and loss-of-heterozygosity states estimated by hidden Markov models (HMM). All methods for detecting DNA copy number aberrations in single human cells have difficulty in confidently discriminating WGA artifacts from true genetic variants. Furthermore, some methods lack thorough validation for segmental DNA imbalance detection. Our protocol minimizes false-positive variant calling and enables uniparental isodisomy detection in single cells. Additionally, it provides quality assessment, allowing the exclusion of uninterpretable single-cell WGA samples. The protocol takes 5-7 d.",

			"abstract": "Genome-wide array approaches and sequencing analyses are powerful tools for identifying genetic aberrations in cancers, including leukemias and lymphomas. However, the clinical and biological significance of such aberrations and their subclonal distribution are poorly understood. Here, we present the first genome-wide array based study of pre-treatment and relapse samples from patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) that uses the computational statistical tool OncoSNP. We show that quantification of the proportion of copy number alterations (CNAs) and copy neutral loss of heterozygosity regions (cnLOHs) in each sample is feasible. Furthermore, we (i) reveal complex changes in the subclonal architecture of paired samples at relapse compared with pre-treatment, (ii) provide evidence supporting an association between increased genomic complexity and poor clinical outcome (iii) report previously undefined, recurrent CNA/cnLOH regions that expand or newly occur at relapse and therefore might harbor candidate driver genes of relapse and/or chemotherapy resistance. Our findings are likely to impact on future therapeutic strategies aimed towards selecting effective and individually tailored targeted therapies.",

			"abstract": "The integrity of the genome depends on diverse pathways that regulate DNA metabolism. Defects in these pathways result in genome instability, a hallmark of cancer. Deletion of ELG1 in budding yeast, when combined with hypomorphic alleles of PCNA results in spontaneous DNA damage during S phase that elicits upregulation of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) activity. Increased RNR activity leads to a dramatic expansion of deoxyribonucleotide (dNTP) pools in G1 that allows cells to synthesize significant fractions of the genome in the presence of hydroxyurea in the subsequent S phase. Consistent with the recognized correlation between dNTP levels and spontaneous mutation, compromising ELG1 and PCNA results in a significant increase in mutation rates. Deletion of distinct genome stability genes RAD54, RAD55, and TSA1 also results in increased dNTP levels and mutagenesis, suggesting that this is a general phenomenon. Together, our data point to a vicious circle in which mutations in gatekeeper genes give rise to genomic instability during S phase, inducing expansion of the dNTP pool, which in turn results in high levels of spontaneous mutagenesis.",

			"abstract": "It has been more than two decades since the original chromosome transmission fidelity (Ctf) screen of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was published. Since that time the spectrum of mutations known to cause Ctf and, more generally, chromosome instability (CIN) has expanded dramatically as a result of systematic screens across yeast mutant arrays. Here we describe a comprehensive summary of the original Ctf genetic screen and the cloning of the remaining complementation groups as efforts to expand our knowledge of the CIN gene repertoire and its mutability in a model eukaryote. At the time of the original screen, it was impossible to predict either the genes and processes that would be overrepresented in a pool of random mutants displaying a Ctf phenotype or what the entire set of genes potentially mutable to Ctf would be. We show that in a collection of 136 randomly selected Ctf mutants, >65% of mutants map to 13 genes, 12 of which are involved in sister chromatid cohesion and/or kinetochore function. Extensive screening of systematic mutant collections has shown that ~350 genes with functions as diverse as RNA processing and proteasomal activity mutate to cause a Ctf phenotype and at least 692 genes are required for faithful chromosome segregation. The enrichment of random Ctf alleles in only 13 of ~350 possible Ctf genes suggests that these genes are more easily mutable to cause genome instability than the others. These observations inform our understanding of recurring CIN mutations in human cancers where presumably random mutations are responsible for initiating the frequently observed CIN phenotype of tumors.",

			"abstract": "The identification of genetic and epigenetic alterations from primary tumor cells has become a common method to identify genes critical to the development and progression of cancer. We seek to identify those genetic and epigenetic aberrations that have the most impact on gene function within the tumor. First, we perform a bioinformatic analysis of copy number variation (CNV) and DNA methylation covering the genetic landscape of ovarian cancer tumor cells. We separately examined CNV and DNA methylation for 42 primary serous ovarian cancer samples using MOMA-ROMA assays and 379 tumor samples analyzed by The Cancer Genome Atlas. We have identified 346 genes with significant deletions or amplifications among the tumor samples. Utilizing associated gene expression data we predict 156 genes with altered copy number and correlated changes in expression. Among these genes CCNE1, POP4, UQCRB, PHF20L1 and C19orf2 were identified within both data sets. We were specifically interested in copy number variation as our base genomic property in the prediction of tumor suppressors and oncogenes in the altered ovarian tumor. We therefore identify changes in DNA methylation and expression for all amplified and deleted genes. We statistically define tumor suppressor and oncogenic features for these modalities and perform a correlation analysis with expression. We predicted 611 potential oncogenes and tumor suppressors candidates by integrating these data types. Genes with a strong correlation for methylation dependent expression changes exhibited at varying copy number aberrations include CDCA8, ATAD2, CDKN2A, RAB25, AURKA, BOP1 and EIF2C3. We provide copy number variation and DNA methylation analysis for over 11,500 individual genes covering the genetic landscape of ovarian cancer tumors. We show the extent of genomic and epigenetic alterations for known tumor suppressors and oncogenes and also use these defined features to identify potential ovarian cancer gene candidates.",

			"abstract": "Whole-exome sequencing (Exome-seq) has been successfully applied in several recent studies. We here sequenced the exomes of 15 pancreatic tumor cell lines and their matched normal samples. We captured 162,073 exons of 16,954 genes and sequenced the targeted regions to a mean coverage of 56-fold. This study identified a total of 1517 somatic mutations and validated 934 mutations by transcriptome sequencing. We detected recurrent mutations in 56 genes. Among them, 41 have not been described. The mutation rates varied widely among cell lines. The diversity of the mutation rates was significantly correlated with the distinct MLH1 copy-number status. Exome-seq revealed intensive genomic instability in a cell line with MLH1 homozygous deletion, indicated by a dramatically elevated rate of somatic substitutions, small insertions/deletions (indels), as well as indels in microsatellites. Notably, we found that MLH1 expression was decreased by nearly half in cell lines with an allelic loss of MLH1. While these cell lines were negative in conventional microsatellite instability assay, they showed a 10.5-fold increase in the rate of somatic indels, e.g., truncating indels in TP53 and TGFBR2, indicating MLH1 haploinsufficiency in the correction of DNA indel errors. We further analyzed the exomes of 15 renal cell carcinomas and confirmed MLH1 haploinsufficiency. We observed a much higher rate of indel mutations in the affected cases and identified recurrent truncating indels in several cancer genes such as VHL, PBRM1, and JARID1C. Together, our data suggest that MLH1 hemizygous deletion, through increasing the rate of indel mutations, could drive the development and progression of sporadic cancers.",

Major developments have been made in cataloguing genetic variation, the International HapMap Project, and with respect to advances in genotyping technologies. These developments are vital for the emergence of genome-wide association studies in the investigation of complex diseases and traits. In parallel, the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has ushered in the 'personal genome sequencing' era for both normal and cancer genomes, and made possible large-scale genome sequencing studies such as the 1000 Genomes Project and the International Cancer Genome Consortium. The high-throughput sequencing and sequence-capture technologies are also providing new opportunities to study Mendelian disorders through exome sequencing and whole-genome sequencing.

			"abstract": "Recent work has established that heterozygous germline GATA2 mutations predispose carriers to familial myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML), \"MonoMAC\" syndrome, and DCML deficiency. Here, we describe a previously unreported MDS family carrying a missense GATA2 mutation (p.Thr354Met), one patient with MDS/AML carrying a frameshift GATA2 mutation (p.Leu332Thrfs*53), another with MDS harboring a GATA2 splice site mutation, and 3 patients exhibiting MDS or MDS/AML who have large deletions encompassing the GATA2 locus. Intriguingly, 2 MDS/AML or \"MonoMAC\" syndrome patients with GATA2 deletions and one with a frameshift mutation also have primary lymphedema. Primary lymphedema occurs as a result of aberrations in the development and/or function of lymphatic vessels, spurring us to investigate whether GATA2 plays a role in the lymphatic vasculature. We demonstrate here that GATA2 protein is present at high levels in lymphatic vessel valves and that GATA2 controls the expression of genes important for programming lymphatic valve development. Our data expand the phenotypes associated with germline GATA2 mutations to include predisposition to primary lymphedema and suggest that complete haploinsufficiency or loss of function of GATA2, rather than missense mutations, is the key predisposing factor for lymphedema onset. Moreover, we reveal a crucial role for GATA2 in lymphatic vascular development.",

			"abstract": "Individual cancers harbor a set of genetic aberrations that can be informative for identifying rational therapies currently available or in clinical trials. We implemented a pilot study to explore the practical challenges of applying high-throughput sequencing in clinical oncology. We enrolled patients with advanced or refractory cancer who were eligible for clinical trials. For each patient, we performed whole-genome sequencing of the tumor, targeted whole-exome sequencing of tumor and normal DNA, and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) of the tumor to identify potentially informative mutations in a clinically relevant time frame of 3 to 4 weeks. With this approach, we detected several classes of cancer mutations including structural rearrangements, copy number alterations, point mutations, and gene expression alterations. A multidisciplinary Sequencing Tumor Board (STB) deliberated on the clinical interpretation of the sequencing results obtained. We tested our sequencing strategy on human prostate cancer xenografts. Next, we enrolled two patients into the clinical protocol and were able to review the results at our STB within 24 days of biopsy. The first patient had metastatic colorectal cancer in which we identified somatic point mutations in NRAS, TP53, AURKA, FAS, and MYH11, plus amplification and overexpression of cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8). The second patient had malignant melanoma, in which we identified a somatic point mutation in HRAS and a structural rearrangement affecting CDKN2C. The STB identified the CDK8 amplification and Ras mutation as providing a rationale for clinical trials with CDK inhibitors or MEK (mitogen-activated or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase) and PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) inhibitors, respectively. Integrative high-throughput sequencing of patients with advanced cancer generates a comprehensive, individual mutational landscape to facilitate biomarker-driven clinical trials in oncology.",

			"abstract": "Genetic alterations can determine the natural history of cancer and its treatment response. With further advances in DNA sequencing technology, multiple novel genetic alterations will be discovered which could be exploited as prognostic, predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers in the development and use of cancer therapeutics. As such, the importance in clinical practice of efficient and robust somatic mutation testing in solid tumours cannot be overemphasized in the current era of personalized medicine. However, significant challenges remain regarding the testing of genetic biomarkers in clinical practice. Reliance on archived formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tumour, obtained from diagnostic biopsies, for testing somatic genetic alterations could restrict the scientific community in asking relevant questions about a patient's cancer biology. Problems inherent with using formalin fixed, archival tissue are well recognized and difficult to resolve. It could be argued that to achieve rapid and efficient incorporation of genetic biomarkers into clinical practice, somatic mutation testing in cancer patients should be simpler, less invasive using a readily available clinical sample, whilst maintaining robustness and reproducibility. In this regard, use of circulating free DNA (cfDNA) from plasma or serum as an alternative and/or additional source of DNA to test cancer specific genetic alterations is an attractive proposition. In light of encouraging results from recent studies, this mini review will discuss the current role and future potential of somatic mutation testing from circulating or cell free DNA derived from the blood of patients with solid tumours.",

			"abstract": "As with other epithelial cancers, lung cancer develops over a period of several years or decades via a series of progressive morphological changes accompanied by molecular alterations that commence in histologically normal epithelium. However the development of lung cancer presents certain unique features that complicates this evaluation. Anatomically the respiratory tree may be divided into central and peripheral compartments having different gross and histological anatomies as well as different functions. In addition, there are three major forms of lung cancer and many minor forms. Many of these forms arise predominantly in either the central or peripheral compartments. Squamous cell and small cell carcinomas predominantly arise in the central compartment, while adenocarcinomas predominantly arise peripherally. Large cell carcinomas are not a single entity but consist of poorly differentiated forms of the other types and, possibly, some truly undifferentiated \"stem cell like\" tumors. The multistage origin of squamous cell carcinomas, because of their central location, can be followed more closely than the peripherally arising adenocarcinomas. Squamous cell carcinomas arise after a series of reactive, metaplastic, premalignant and preinvasive changes. However, long term observations indicate that not all tumors follow a defined histologic course, and the clinical course, especially of early lesions, is difficult to predict. Peripheral adenocarcinomas are believed to arise from precursor lesions known as atypical adenomatous hyperplasias and may have extensive in situ growth before becoming invasive. Small cell carcinomas are believed to arise from severely molecularly damaged epithelium without going through recognizable preneoplastic changes. The molecular changes that occur prior to the onset on invasive cancers are extensive. As documented in this chapter, they encompass all of the six classic Hallmarks of Cancer other than invasion and metastasis, which by definition occur beyond preneoplasia. A study of preinvasive lung cancer has yielded much valuable biologic information that impacts on clinical management.",

However, there are many practical problems with this personalized medicine approach: (i) cancers often generate treatment-resistant phenotypes, (ii) the treatment could be enormously expensive, and (iii) most of the targeted drugs have not been developed yet. We propose a different approach: therapies that combine 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) with Bcl-2 antagonist such as ABT-263/737 (ABT). Proapoptotic protein Bak is normally sequestered by Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL. Only when Bak is released from both Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL can it induce apoptosis. 2DG can prime highly glycolytic cells by dissociating Bak-Mcl-1 complex. Some brain cells and most cancer cells are primed by 2DG. ABT can bind to Bcl-xL, dissociating Bak-Bcl-xL complex, freeing Bak and inducing apoptosis. Because ABT cannot cross blood-brain barrier, the only cells exposed to both agents are highly glycolytic cancer cells located outside the brain. Because ABT directly triggers apoptosis at the step very near the terminal point of apoptosis, 2DG-ABT combination therapies are applicable to many types of cancer at all stages of development, with little side effect.",

The insights gleamed from these genomic profiling studies with regards to glioblastoma etiology has been particularly satisfying because it cemented the clinical pertinence of major concepts in cancer biology-concepts developed over the past three decades. This article will review how the glioblastoma genomic data set serves as an illustrative platform for the concepts put forward by Hanahan and Weinberg on the cancer phenotype. The picture emerging suggests that most glioblastomas evolve along a multitude of pathways rather than a single defined pathway. In this context, the article will further provide a discussion of the subtypes of glioblastoma as they relate to key principles of developmental neurobiology.",

But, with cancer drug costs now spiraling out of control and the modest efficacy typically seen in patients, the community is again turning to Hippocrates' ancient paradigm--this time with emphasis on molecular considerations.

If so, the use of inflammation by the cancer-initiating cell can also be supported in the ability to reacquire extraembryonic functional axes for tumor development, invasion, and metastasis. Thus, the diverse components of the tumor microenvironment could represent the overlapping reexpression of amniotic and vitelline functions.

Proposed here is an expansion on the idea of ecological therapy of cancer, incorporating 1) literature on species invasion, i.e., a right cancerous clone needs to be at the right place at the right time to actually invade its environment, and 2) the literature on niche construction, that is, the idea that once a tumor is formed, cancer cells they modify their microenvironment (niche construction) by changing pH through glycolysis, secreting growth factors and recruiting tumor-associated macrophages to promote cell growth, activating fibroblasts, evading predation from immune system, making the cancer that much more difficult to eradicate. Paleontological literature suggests that the largestmass extinctions occurred when environmental stress that would weaken the population was coupled with some pulse destructive event that caused extensive mortality. To have the same effect on cells in the tumor, rather than, or at least in addition to, killing the cells, one would also need to target the niche that they created for themselves.",

To elucidate translocation mechanisms in mammalian cells, we developed high-throughput, genome-wide translocation sequencing (HTGTS).

DSBs translocated widely across the genome but were preferentially targeted to transcribed chromosomal regions. Additionally, numerous AID-dependent and AID-independent hot spots were targeted, with the latter comprising mainly cryptic I-SceI targets. Comparison of translocation junctions with genome-wide nuclear run-ons revealed a marked association between transcription start sites and translocation targeting. The majority of translocation junctions were formed via end-joining with short microhomologies. Our findings have implications for diverse fields, including gene therapy and cancer genomics.",

			"abstract": "A decade has elapsed since the concept of oncogene addiction was first proposed. It postulates that - despite the diverse array of genetic lesions typical of cancer - some tumours rely on one single dominant oncogene for growth and survival, so that inhibition of this specific oncogene is sufficient to halt the neoplastic phenotype. A large amount of evidence has proven the pervasive power of this notion, both in basic research and in therapeutic applications. However, in the face of such a considerable body of knowledge, the intimate molecular mechanisms mediating this phenomenon remain elusive. At the clinical level, successful translation of the oncogene addiction model into the rational and effective design of targeted therapeutics against individual oncoproteins still faces major obstacles, mainly due to the emergence of escape mechanisms and drug resistance. Here, we offer an overview of the relevant literature, encompassing both biological aspects and recent clinical insights. We discuss the key advantages and pitfalls of this concept and reconsider it as an illustrative principle to guide post-genomic cancer research and drug development.",

The compound 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), in contrast, partially blocks glycolysis, slowing cell growth but rarely causing cell death. Injected into an animal, 2DG accumulates predominantly in tumors but does not harm other tissues. However, when cells that were highly resistant to ABT were pre-treated with 2DG for 3 hours, ABT became a potent inducer of apoptosis, rapidly releasing cytochrome c from the mitochondria and activating caspases at submicromolar concentrations in a Bak/Bax-dependent manner. Bak is normally sequestered in complexes with Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL. 2DG primes cells by interfering with Bak-Mcl-1 association, making it easier for ABT to dissociate Bak from Bcl-xL, freeing Bak to induce apoptosis. A highly active glucose transporter and Bid, as an agent of the mitochondrial apoptotic signal amplification loop, are necessary for efficient apoptosis induction in this system. This combination treatment of cancer-bearing mice was very effective against tumor xenograft from hormone-independent highly metastasized chemo-resistant human prostate cancer cells, suggesting that the combination treatment may provide a safe and effective alternative to genotoxin-based cancer therapies.",

While pathway analysis has been a powerful tool in cancer genomics, our knowledge of oncogenic pathway modules is incomplete. To systematically identify such modules, we have developed a novel method, Mutual Exclusivity Modules in cancer (MEMo). The method uses correlation analysis and statistical tests to identify network modules by three criteria: (1) Member genes are recurrently altered across a set of tumor samples; (2) member genes are known to or are likely to participate in the same biological process; and (3) alteration events within the modules are mutually exclusive. Applied to data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the method identifies the principal known altered modules in glioblastoma (GBM) and highlights the striking mutual exclusivity of genomic alterations in the PI(3)K, p53, and Rb pathways. In serous ovarian cancer, we make the novel observation that inactivation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 is mutually exclusive of amplification of CCNE1 and inactivation of RB1, suggesting distinct alternative causes of genomic instability in this cancer type; and, we identify RBBP8 as a candidate oncogene involved in Rb-mediated cell cycle control. When applied to any cancer genomics data set, the algorithm can nominate oncogenic alterations that have a particularly strong selective effect and may also be useful in the design of therapeutic combinations in cases where mutual exclusivity reflects synthetic lethality.",

			"abstract": "In many biological scenarios, from the development of drug resistance in pathogens to the progression of healthy cells toward cancer, quantifying the selection acting on observed mutations is a central question. One difficulty in answering this question is the complexity of the background upon which mutations can arise, with multiple potential interactions between genetic loci. We here present a method for discerning selection from a population history that accounts for interference between mutations. Given sequences sampled from multiple time points in the history of a population, we infer selection at each locus by maximizing a likelihood function derived from a multilocus evolution model. We apply the method to the question of distinguishing between loci where new mutations are under positive selection (drivers) and loci that emit neutral mutations (passengers) in a Wright-Fisher model of evolution. Relative to an otherwise equivalent method in which the genetic background of mutations was ignored, our method inferred selection coefficients more accurately for both driver mutations evolving under clonal interference and passenger mutations reaching fixation in the population through genetic drift or hitchhiking. In a population history recorded by 750 sets of sequences of 100 individuals taken at intervals of 100 generations, a set of 50 loci were divided into drivers and passengers with a mean accuracy of >0.95 across a range of numbers of driver loci. The potential application of our model, either in full or in part, to a range of biological systems, is discussed.",

Excess NADH reduces nine of the ten prosthetic groups of the enzyme in bovine-heart submitochondrial particles with a rate of at least 3,300 s\u207b\u00b9. This results in an overall NADH\u2192O\u2082 rate of ca. 150 s\u207b\u00b9. It has long been known that the bovine enzyme also has a specific reaction site for NADPH. At neutral pH excess NADPH reduces only three to four of the prosthetic groups in Complex I with a rate of 40 s\u207b\u00b9 at 22 \u00b0C. The reducing equivalents remain essentially locked in the enzyme because the overall NADPH\u2192O\u2082 rate (1.4 s\u207b\u00b9) is negligible. The physiological significance of the reaction with NADPH is still unclear. A number of recent developments has revived our thinking about this enigma. We hypothesize that Complex I and the \u0394p-driven nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (Nnt) co-operate in an energy-dependent attenuation of the hydrogen-peroxide generation by Complex I. This co-operation is thought to be mediated by the NADPH/NADP\u207a ratio in the vicinity of the NADPH site of Complex I. It is proposed that the specific H\u2082O\u2082 production by Complex I, and the attenuation of it, is of importance for apoptosis, autophagy and the survival mechanism of a number of cancers. Verification of this hypothesis may contribute to a better understanding of the regulation of these processes.",

			"abstract": "Alterations in DNA copy number contribute to the development and progression of cancers and are common in epithelial tumors. We have used array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) to visualize DNA copy number alterations across the genomes of lung tumors in the Kras(LA2) model of lung cancer. Copy number gain involving the Kras locus, as focal amplification or whole chromosome gain, is the most common alteration in these tumors and with a prevalence that increased significantly with increasing tumor size. Furthermore, Kras amplification was the only major genomic event among the smallest lung tumors, suggesting that this alteration occurs early during the development of mutant Kras-driven lung cancers. Recurring gains and deletions of other chromosomes occur progressively more frequently among larger tumors. These results are in contrast to a previous aCGH analysis of lung tumors from Kras(LA2) mice on a mixed genetic background, in which relatively few DNA copy number alterations were observed regardless of tumor size. Our model features the Kras(LA2) allele on the inbred FVB/N mouse strain, and in this genetic background, there is a highly statistically significant increase in level of genomic instability with increasing tumor size. These data suggest that recurring DNA copy alterations are important for tumor progression in the Kras(LA2) model of lung cancer and that the requirement for these alterations may be dependent on the genetic background of the mouse strain.",

			"abstract": "Cancer is an evolutionary process that arises due to mutations and expands through the selection of clones with higher reproductive success that will outcompete their peers. Most tumors require many mutations to explain the cancer phenotype, making it difficult to identify the gene(s) that confer the reproductive fitness to the clone. Moreover, the impact of any oncogene is context dependent: it can increase the fitness of particular stages of cell differentiation but not other stages. In addition, the fitness advantage of an oncogene is not irreversible: sometimes it can be reversed with targeted therapy, for example. The understanding of these dynamical processes and their consequences may be greatly simplified when addressed from an evolutionary perspective. Using the dynamics of chronic myeloid leukemia-perhaps the best understood human neoplasm-as an example, we show how three fundamental evolutionary behaviors provide insights into the dynamics of this disease: (1) BCR-ABL does not affect the reproductive success of any cell within the stem cell pool (resulting therefore in neutral drift), (2) BCR-ABL expression gives a fitness (selective) advantage to progenitor cells, and (3) imatinib therapy reduces the fitness of progenitor cells expressing the oncogene (selective disadvantage) and consequently leads to significant reductions in disease burden. These three different evolutionary dynamics scenarios based on the interpretation of mutation and gene expression as potentially leading to a fitness imbalance of cell populations clearly explain the course of the disease, providing as such a better grasp of cancer dynamics and the role of related therapies.",

Growing evidence shows that acquired epigenetic abnormalities participate with genetic alterations to cause altered patterns of gene expression/function. It has been established beyond doubt that promoter cytosine methylation in CpG islands, and the subsequent gene silencing, is intimately involved in cancer development. These epigenetic events very likely contribute to significant variation in gene expression profiling, phenotypic features, and biologic characteristics seen in PTC. Hypermethylation of promoter regions has also been analyzed in PTC, and most studies have focused on individual genes or a small cohort of genes implicated in tumorigenesis.",

Evaluation of the effects of these mutations is essential for understanding their contribution to tumorigenesis. We have used SNPs3D, a software suite originally developed for analyzing nonsynonymous germ-line variants, to identify single-base mutations with a high impact on protein structure and function. Two machine learning methods are used: one identifying mutations that destabilize protein three-dimensional structure and the other utilizing sequence conservation and detecting all types of effects on in vivo protein function. Incorporation of detailed structure information into the analysis allows detailed interpretation of the functional effects of mutations in specific cases.\u00a0 Data from a set of breast and colorectal tumors were analyzed. In known cancer genes, mutations approaching 100% of mutations are found to impact protein function, supporting the view that these methods are appropriate for identifying driver mutations. Overall, 50-60% of all somatic missense mutations are predicted to have a high impact on structural stability or to more generally affect the function of the corresponding proteins. This value is similar to the fraction of all possible missense mutations that have a high impact and is much higher than the corresponding one for human population single-nucleotide polymorphisms, at about 30%. The majority of mutations in tumor suppressors destabilize protein structure, while mutations in oncogenes operate in more varied ways, including destabilization of less active conformational states.

Many SCNA breakpoints are spatially clustered in cancer genomes. We observed a significant enrichment for G-quadruplex sequences (G4s) in the vicinity of SCNA breakpoints and established that SCNAs show a strand bias consistent with G4-mediated structural alterations. Notably, abnormal hypomethylation near G4s-rich regions is a common signature for many SCNA breakpoint hotspots.

The conditions are meant to mimic the tight spaces in the physiological environment that cancer cells encounter during metastasis within the matrix dense stroma and during intravasation and extravasation through the vascular wall. In this study we use the assay to investigate the relative probabilities of a cell 1) permeating and 2) repolarizing (turning around) when it migrates into a spatially confining region. We observe the existence of both states even within a single cell line, indicating phenotypic heterogeneity in cell migration invasiveness and persistence. We also show that varying the spatial gradient of the taper can induce behavioral changes in cells, and different cell types respond differently to spatial changes. Particularly, for bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs), higher spatial gradients induce more cells to permeate (60%) than lower gradients (12%). Furthermore, highly metastatic breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) demonstrate a more invasive and permeative nature (87%) than non-metastatic breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A) (25%). We examine the migration dynamics of cells in the tapered region and derive characteristic constants that quantify this transition process. Our data indicate that cell response to physical spatial gradients is both cell-type specific and heterogeneous within a cell population, analogous to the behaviors reported to occur during tumor progression. Incorporation of micro-architectures in confined channels enables the probing of migration behaviors specific to defined geometries that mimic in vivo microenvironments.",

Large-scale sequencing of cancer genomes is revealing an increasing number of potential driver mutations that may allow specific targeting of cancer genes, proteins, and pathways.

There are now many examples where mutation profiles observed in tumours have been shown to correlate with clinical features of disease, drug response, and patient outcomes. When ignored, molecular heterogeneity can lead to failures in drug development, as drugs that may have efficacy in subgroups of patients with specific molecular phenotypes may show marginal response when tested in large groups of unselected patients.

The lack of integration of the different aspects of causality into a common framework could postpone our attempts to build a human causal model of carcinogenesis. We present here some aspects of differences in methodology, terminology and traditions between the scientific disciplines and propose a research strategy using functional analyses of the transcriptome and epigenetics to illuminate causality in complex biological systems. Overcoming the challenges of biological material collection suitable for such analyses into a prospective design, this could give unique opportunities for verification of mechanistic information from basic biological research in a human model system. The ultimate goal is to obtain a dynamic causal description of the different carcinogenesis stages. The success of this novel approach depends on the biological relationship between the gene expression of the somatic driver mutations or co-expressed genes in tumours and the gene expressions mirrored in peripheral blood along the different stages of carcinogenesis. The use of gene expression profiles and epigenetics could produce a functional concept of causality to explain the human multistage carcinogenic process.",

The SMT has not been rigorously tested, and several lines of evidence raise questions that are not addressed by this theory. Herein, we propose experimental strategies that may validate the SMT. We also call attention to an alternative theory of carcinogenesis, the tissue organization field theory (TOFT), which posits that cancer is a tissue-based disease and that proliferation is the default state of all cells. Based on epistemological and experimental evidence, we argue that the TOFT compellingly explains carcinogenesis, while placing it within an evolutionarily relevant context.",

			"abstract": "The transformation of a normal cell into a cancer cell takes place through a sequence of a small number of discrete genetic events, somatic mutations: thus, cancer can be regarded properly as a genetic disease of somatic cells. The analogy between evolution of organisms and evolution of cell populations is compelling: in both cases what drives change is mutation, but it is Darwinian selection that enables clones that have a growth advantage to expand, thus providing a larger target size for the next mutation to hit. The search for molecular lesions in tumors has taken on a new dimension thanks to two powerful technologies: the micro-arrays for quantitative analysis of global gene expresssion (the transcriptome); and 'deep' sequencing for the global analysis of the entire genome (or at least the exome). The former offers the most complete phenotypic characterization of a tumor we could ever hope for--we could call this the ultimate phenotype; the latter can identify all the somatic mutations in an individual tumor--we could call this the somatic genotype. However, there is definitely the risk that while we are 'drowned by data, we remain thirsty for knowledge'. If we want to heed the teachings of Lorenzo Tomatis, I think the message is clear: we ought to take advantage of the new powerful technologies--not by becoming their slaves, but remaining their masters. Identifying somatic mutations in a tumor is important not because it qualifies for 'oncogenomics', but because through a deeper understanding of the nature of that particular tumor it can help us to optimize therapy or to design new therapeutic approaches.",

			"abstract": "Carcinogenesis is a complex process with multiple genetic and environmental factors contributing to the development of one or more tumors. Understanding the underlying mechanism of this process and identifying related markers to assess the outcome of this process would lead to more directed treatment and thus significantly reduce the mortality rate of cancers. Recently, molecular diagnostics and prognostics based on the identification of patterns within gene expression profiles in the context of protein interaction networks were reported. However, the predictive performances of these approaches were limited. In this study we propose a novel integrated approach, named CAERUS, for the identification of gene signatures to predict cancer outcomes based on the domain interaction network in human proteome. We first developed a model to score each protein by quantifying the domain connections to its interacting partners and the somatic mutations present in the domain. We then defined proteins as gene signatures if their scores were above a preset threshold. Next, for each gene signature, we quantified the correlation of the expression levels between this gene signature and its neighboring proteins. The results of the quantification in each patient were then used to predict cancer outcome by a modified na\u00efve Bayes classifier. In this study we achieved a favorable accuracy of 88.3%, sensitivity of 87.2%, and specificity of 88.9% on a set of well-documented gene expression profiles of 253 consecutive breast cancer patients with different outcomes. We also compiled a list of cancer-associated gene signatures and domains, which provided testable hypotheses for further experimental investigation. Our approach proved successful on different independent breast cancer data sets as well as an ovarian cancer data set. This study constitutes the first predictive method to classify cancer outcomes based on the relationship between the domain organization and protein network.",

Understanding the implications of these DNA modifications in the etiology of human diseases requires the examination about how these DNA lesions block DNA replication and induce mutations in cells. All previously reported shuttle vector-based methods for investigating the cytotoxic and mutagenic properties of DNA lesions in cells have low-throughput, where plasmids containing individual lesions are transfected into cells one lesion at a time and the products from the replication of individual lesions are analyzed separately. The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has facilitated investigators to design scientific approaches that were previously not technically feasible or affordable. In this study, we developed a new method employing NGS, together with shuttle vector technology, to have a multiplexed and quantitative assessment of how DNA lesions perturb the efficiency and accuracy of DNA replication in cells. By using this method, we examined the replication of four carboxymethylated DNA lesions and two oxidatively induced bulky DNA lesions including (5'S) diastereomers of 8,5'-cyclo-2'-deoxyguanosine (cyclo-dG) and 8,5'-cyclo-2'-deoxyadenosine (cyclo-dA) in five different strains of Escherichia coli cells. We further validated the results obtained from NGS using previously established methods. Taken together, the newly developed method provided a high-throughput and readily affordable method for assessing quantitatively how DNA lesions compromise the efficiency and fidelity of DNA replication in cells.",

			"abstract": "A key goal in cancer research is to find the genomic alterations that underlie malignant cells. Genomics has proved successful in identifying somatic variants at a large scale. However, it has become evident that a typical cancer exhibits a heterogenous mutation pattern across samples. Cases where the same alteration is observed repeatedly seem to be the exception rather than the norm. Thus, pinpointing the key alterations (driver mutations) from a background of variations with no direct causal link to cancer (passenger mutations) is difficult. Here we analyze somatic missense mutations from cancer samples and their healthy tissue counterparts (germline mutations) from the viewpoint of germline fitness. We calibrate a scoring system from protein domain alignments to score mutations and their target loci. We show first that this score predicts to a good degree the rate of polymorphism of the observed germline variation. The scoring is then applied to somatic mutations. We show that candidate cancer genes prone to copy number loss harbor mutations with germline fitness effects that are significantly more deleterious than expected by chance. This suggests that missense mutations play a driving role in tumor suppressor genes. Furthermore, these mutations fall preferably onto loci in sequence neighborhoods that are high scoring in terms of germline fitness. In contrast, for somatic mutations in candidate onco genes we do not observe a statistically significant effect. These results help to inform how to exploit germline fitness predictions in discovering new genes and mutations responsible for cancer.",

Parallelization and miniaturization of DNA sequencing enables massive data throughput and for the first time, large-scale, nucleotide resolution views of cancer genomes can be achieved. Systematic, large-scale sequencing surveys have revealed that the genetic spectrum of mutations in cancers appears to be highly complex with numerous low frequency bystander somatic variations, and a limited number of common, frequently mutated genes. Large sample sizes and deeper resequencing are much needed in resolving clinical and biological relevance of the mutations as well as in detecting somatic variants in heterogeneous samples and cancer cell sub-populations. However, even with the next-generation sequencing technologies, the overwhelming size of the human genome and need for very high fold coverage represents a major challenge for up-scaling cancer genome sequencing projects. Assays to target, capture, enrich or partition disease-specific regions of the genome offer immediate solutions for reducing the complexity of the sequencing libraries.

While it has been shown that these fusions cause constitutive activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway, very little is known about their formation. Here, we present a detailed analysis of RAF gene fusion breakpoints from a well-characterized cohort of 43 low-grade astrocytomas. Our findings show that the rearrangements that generate these RAF gene fusions may be simple or complex and that both inserted nucleotides and microhomology are common at the DNA breakpoints. Furthermore, we identify novel enrichment of microhomologous sequences in the regions immediately flanking the breakpoints. We thus provide evidence that the tandem duplications responsible for these fusions are generated by microhomology-mediated break-induced replication (MMBIR). Although MMBIR has previously been implicated in the pathogenesis of other diseases and the evolution of eukaryotic genomes, we demonstrate here that the proposed details of MMBIR are consistent with a recurrent rearrangement in cancer. Our analysis of repetitive elements, Z-DNA and sequence motifs in the fusion partners identified significant enrichment of the human minisatellite conserved sequence/\u03c7-like element at one side of the breakpoint. Therefore, in addition to furthering our understanding of low-grade astrocytomas, this study provides insights into the molecular mechanistic details of MMBIR and the sequence of events that occur in the formation of genomic rearrangements.",

			"abstract": "Cancer originates from cells that have acquired mutations in genes critical for controlling cell proliferation, survival and differentiation. Often, tumors continue to depend on these so-called driver mutations, providing the rationale for targeted anticancer therapies. To date, large-scale sequencing analyses have revealed hundreds of mutations in human tumors. However, without their functional validation it remains unclear which mutations correspond to driver, or rather bystander, mutations and, therefore, whether the mutated gene represents a target for therapeutic intervention. In human colorectal tumors, the neurotrophic receptor TRKB has been found mutated on two different sites in its kinase domain (TRKB(T695I) and TRKB(D751N)). Another site, in the extracellular part of TRKB, is mutated in a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line (TRKB(L138F)). Lastly, our own analysis has identified one additional TRKB point mutation proximal to the kinase domain (TRKB(P507L)) in a human melanoma cell line. The functional consequences of all these point mutations, however, have so far remained elusive. Previously, we have shown that TRKB is a potent suppressor of anoikis and that TRKB-expressing cells form highly invasive and metastatic tumors in nude mice. To assess the functional consequences of these four TRKB mutations, we determined their potential to suppress anoikis and to form tumors in nude mice. Unexpectedly, both colon cancer-derived mutants, TRKB(T695I) and TRKB(D751N), displayed reduced activity compared to that of wild-type TRKB. Consistently, upon stimulation with the TRKB ligand BDNF, these mutants were impaired in activating TRKB and its downstream effectors AKT and ERK. The two mutants derived from human tumor cell lines (TRKB(L138F) and TRKB(P507L)) were functionally indistinguishable from wild-type TRKB in both in-vitro and in-vivo assays. In conclusion, we fail to detect any gain-of-function of four cancer-derived TRKB point mutations.",

In addition, the current methods do not provide robust estimates of the statistical confidence of their results, and the sensitivity of this approach has not been rigorously evaluated. Here, we present CHILD, a tool specifically designed for indel detection in mixtures where one variant is rare. CHILD makes use of standard sequence alignment statistics to evaluate the significance of the results. The sensitivity of CHILD was tested by sequencing controlled mixtures of deleted and undeleted plasmids at various ratios. Our results indicate that CHILD can identify deleted molecules present as just 5% of the mixture. Notably, the results were plasmid/primer-specific; for some primers and/or plasmids, the deleted molecule was only detected when it comprised 10% or more of the mixture. The false positive rate was estimated to be lower than 0.4%. CHILD was implemented as a user-oriented web site, providing a sensitive and experimentally validated method for the detection of rare indel-carrying molecules in common Sanger sequence reads.",

Another hypothesis puts its emphasis on the natural selection of gene mutations for fitness. Recent data for systematic cancer genome sequencing shows that mutations in stability genes are rare in human sporadic cancers. Instead, many \u201cpassenger\u201d mutations that do not drive the carcinogenesis process have been found in the cancer genome. Both the hypotheses mentioned above fall short in explaining recent data. Recently, many studies demonstrate the role of the tumor microenvironment, especially hypoxia and reoxygenation, in genetic instability.

			"abstract": "Interest in the topic of tumour metabolism has waxed and waned over the past century of cancer research. The early observations of Warburg and his contemporaries established that there are fundamental differences in the central metabolic pathways operating in malignant tissue. However, the initial hypotheses that were based on these observations proved inadequate to explain tumorigenesis, and the oncogene revolution pushed tumour metabolism to the margins of cancer research. In recent years, interest has been renewed as it has become clear that many of the signalling pathways that are affected by genetic mutations and the tumour microenvironment have a profound effect on core metabolism, making this topic once again one of the most intense areas of research in cancer biology.",

While somatic RB1 mutations have been detected in different malignancies, information about the potential role of RB1 mutations in breast cancer is limited. Recently, we discovered RB1 mutations to be associated with resistance to anthracyclines/mitomycin in primary breast cancer. The present work is the first report evaluating RB1 mutation and epigenetic status in metastatic breast cancer. Among 148 breast cancer samples analyzed by MLPA, four samples harbored intragenic deletions/duplications: Thus, exons 1-2 were deleted in two tumors and exons 21-23 in one tumor, while one sample harbored duplication of exons 18-23. The entire RB1 gene was duplicated in two tumors and multiple amplifications were revealed in one sample. Reduced copy number was observed in 17 samples (11.5%). No point mutation or promoter hypermethylation was discovered (n = 38 and 114 tumors analyzed, respectively). Interestingly, among seven tumors expressing lack of response to epirubicin, two samples harbored alterations in RB1, contrasting none out of 16 tumors with stable disease or an objective response (P = 0.08). In summary, the frequency of RB1 alterations in metastatic lesions was not increased when compared to primary breast cancer, indicating that RB1 alterations do not play a major role in metastatic development. While a non-significant association suggesting RB1 alterations to be linked to therapy resistance was observed, our data do not suggest a major role for RB1 alterations explaining acquired drug resistance.",

			"abstract": "Cancer biomarkers are currently the subject of intense research because of their potential utility for diagnosis, prognosis, and targeted therapy. In theory, the gene products resulting from somatic mutations are the ultimate protein biomarkers, being not simply associated with tumors but actually responsible for tumorigenesis. We show here that the altered protein products resulting from somatic mutations can be identified directly and quantified by mass spectrometry. The peptides expressed from normal and mutant alleles were detected by selected reaction monitoring (SRM) of their product ions using a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. As a prototypical example of this approach, we demonstrated that it is possible to quantify the number and fraction of mutant Ras protein present in cancer cell lines. There were an average of 1.3 million molecules of Ras protein per cell, and the ratio of mutant to normal Ras proteins ranged from 0.49 to 5.6. Similarly, we found that mutant Ras proteins could be detected and quantified in clinical specimens such as colorectal and pancreatic tumor tissues as well as in premalignant pancreatic cyst fluids. In addition to answering basic questions about the relative levels of genetically abnormal proteins in tumors, this approach could prove useful for diagnostic applications.",

			"abstract": "Progress in an understanding of the genetic basis of cancer coupled to molecular pharmacology of potential new anticancer drugs calls for new approaches that are able to address key issues in the drug development process, including pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) relationships. The incorporation of predictive preclinical PK/PD models into rationally designed early-stage clinical trials offers a promising way to relieve a significant bottleneck in the drug discovery pipeline. The aim of the current review is to discuss some considerations for how quantitative PK and PD analyses for anticancer drugs may be conducted and integrated into a global translational effort, and the importance of examining drug disposition and dynamics in target tissues to support the development of preclinical PK/PD models that can be subsequently extrapolated to predict pharmacologic characteristics in patients. In this article, we describe three different physiologically based (PB) PK modeling approaches, i.e., the whole-body PBPK model, the hybrid PBPK model, and the two-pore model for macromolecules, as well as their applications. General conclusions are that greater effort should be made to generate more clinical data that could validate scaled preclinical PB-PK/PD tumor-based models and, thus, stimulate a framework for preclinical to clinical translation. Finally, given the innovative techniques to measure tissue drug concentrations and associated biomarkers of drug responses, development of predictive PK/PD models will become a standard approach for drug discovery and development.",

			"abstract": "Cancer is driven by somatically acquired point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, conventionally thought to accumulate gradually over time. Using next-generation sequencing, we characterize a phenomenon, which we term chromothripsis, whereby tens to hundreds of genomic rearrangements occur in a one-off cellular crisis. Rearrangements involving one or a few chromosomes crisscross back and forth across involved regions, generating frequent oscillations between two copy number states. These genomic hallmarks are highly improbable if rearrangements accumulate over time and instead imply that nearly all occur during a single cellular catastrophe. The stamp of chromothripsis can be seen in at least 2%-3% of all cancers, across many subtypes, and is present in \u223c25% of bone cancers. We find that one, or indeed more than one, cancer-causing lesion can emerge out of the genomic crisis. This phenomenon has important implications for the origins of genomic remodeling and temporal emergence of cancer.",

Previous studies have implicated replication stress as a causative factor in CNV formation. However, existing data are technically limited in the quality of comparisons that can be made between human CNVs and experimentally induced variants. Here, we used two high-resolution strategies-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays and mate-pair sequencing-to compare CNVs that occur constitutionally to those that arise following aphidicolin-induced DNA replication stress in the same human cells. Although the optimized methods provided complementary information, sequencing was more sensitive to small variants and provided superior structural descriptions. The majority of constitutional and all aphidicolin-induced CNVs appear to be formed via homology-independent mechanisms, while aphidicolin-induced CNVs were of a larger median size than constitutional events even when mate-pair data were considered. Aphidicolin thus appears to stimulate formation of CNVs that closely resemble human pathogenic CNVs and the subset of larger nonhomologous constitutional CNVs.",

			"abstract": "The search for improved molecular cancer diagnostics is a challenge for which systems approaches show great promise. As is becoming increasingly clear, cancer is a perpetually-evolving, highly multi-factorial disease. With next generation sequencing providing an ever-increasing amount of high-throughput data, the need for analytical tools that can provide meaningful context is critical. Systems approaches have demonstrated an ability to separate meaningful signal from noise that arises from population heterogeneity, heterogeneity within and across tumors, and multiple sources of technical variation when sufficient sample sizes are obtained and standardized measurement technologies are used. The ability to develop clinically useful molecular cancer diagnostics will be predicated on advancements on two major fronts: 1) more comprehensive and accurate measurements of multiple endpoints, and 2) more sophisticated analytical tools that synthesize high-throughput data into meaningful reflections of cellular states. To this end, systems approaches that have integrated transcriptomic data onto biomolecular networks have shown promise in their ability to classify tumor subtypes, predict clinical progression, and inform treatment options. Ultimately, the success of systems approaches will be measured by their ability to develop molecular cancer diagnostics through distilling complex, systems-wide information into actionable information in the clinic.",

However, the contribution of these two routes to hepatocarcinogenesis has not been determined, partly because of the difficulty in distinguishing damaged and regenerated hepatocytes. Here we report that induced deletion of the damaged DNA binding protein 1 (DDB1) abrogates the self-renewing capacity of hepatocytes, resulting in compensatory proliferation of DDB1-expressing hepatocytes. Constitutive stimulation of this regeneration process leads to development of hepatocellular carcinoma, which surprisingly contains no disruption of the DDB1 gene, indicating a cell-nonautonomous role of DDB1 inactivation in tumor initiation. Our results suggest that viruses and hepatoxins may cause liver tumors by simply driving hepatocyte turnover without directly targeting cancer cells.",

			"abstract": "Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified candidate genes contributing to cancer risk through low-penetrance mutations. Many of these genes were unexpected and, intriguingly, included well-known players in carcinogenesis at the somatic level. To assess the hypothesis of a germline-somatic link in carcinogenesis, we evaluated the distribution of somatic gene labels within the ordered results of a breast cancer risk GWAS. This analysis suggested frequent influence on risk of genetic variation in loci encoding for \"driver kinases\" (i.e., kinases encoded by genes that showed higher somatic mutation rates than expected by chance and, therefore, whose deregulation may contribute to cancer development and/or progression). Assessment of these predictions using a population-based case-control study in Poland replicated the association for rs3732568 in EPHB1 (odds ratio (OR)\u200a=\u200a0.79; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.63-0.98; P(trend)\u200a=\u200a0.031). Analyses by early age at diagnosis and by estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) tumor status indicated potential associations for rs6852678 in CDKL2 (OR\u200a=\u200a0.32, 95% CI: 0.10-1.00; P(recessive)\u200a=\u200a0.044) and rs10878640 in DYRK2 (OR\u200a=\u200a2.39, 95% CI: 1.32-4.30; P(dominant)\u200a=\u200a0.003), and for rs12765929, rs9836340, rs4707795 in BMPR1A, EPHA3 and EPHA7, respectively (ER\u03b1 tumor status P(interaction)<0.05). The identification of three novel candidates as EPH receptor genes might indicate a link between perturbed compartmentalization of early neoplastic lesions and breast cancer risk and progression. Together, these data may lay the foundations for replication in additional populations and could potentially increase our knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanisms of breast carcinogenesis.",

The role of MLL3 in breast cancer, however, remains unknown. In this study, we sequenced all 59 exons of MLL3 (14.7 Kb coding sequence) in 38 breast cancers from Chinese women, and found three somatic mutations in two of the cases, including one frameshift mutation (c.2687 ins A) that truncates the majority of the MLL3 protein, and two synonymous mutations. In addition to 24 known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 5 novel SNPs were also detected in the 38 women; and interestingly, all the 5 novel SNPs alter amino acid sequences of MLL3 thus could have functional consequences. We also examined the expression of MLL3 mRNA in 30 breast tumors and their matched normal breast tissues. While no associations were found between expression change and clinicopathologic parameters, 40% of the samples showed reduced expression in cancer tissues. These results suggest that mutation of MLL3 plays a role in the development of breast cancer.",

To identify glioblastoma-targeted genes, we completed a multifaceted genome-wide analysis to characterize the most significant aberrations of DNA content occurring in glioblastomas. We performed copy number analysis of 111 glioblastomas by Digital Karyotyping and Illumina BeadChip assays and validated our findings using data from the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) glioblastoma project. From this study, we identified recurrent focal copy number alterations in 1p36.23 and 4p16.3. Expression analyses of genes located in the two regions revealed genes which are dysregulated in glioblastomas. Specifically, we identify EGFR negative regulator, ERRFI1, within the minimal region of deletion in 1p36.23. In glioblastoma cells with a focal deletion of the ERRFI1 locus, restoration of ERRFI1 expression slowed cell migration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TACC3, an Aurora-A kinase substrate, on 4p16.3, displays gain of copy number, is overexpressed in a glioma-grade-specific pattern, and correlates with Aurora kinase overexpression in glioblastomas. Our multifaceted genomic evaluation of glioblastoma establishes ERRFI1 as a potential candidate tumor suppressor gene and TACC3 as a potential oncogene, and provides insight on targets for oncogenic pathway-based therapy.",

			"abstract": "One of the greatest challenges in biomedicine is to define the critical targets and network interactions that are subverted to elicit growth deregulation in human cells. Understanding and developing rational treatments for cancer requires a definition of the key molecular targets and how they interact to elicit the complex growth deregulation phenotype. Viral proteins provide discerning and powerful probes to understand both how cells work and how they can be manipulated using a minimal number of components. The small DNA viruses have evolved to target inherent weaknesses in cellular protein interaction networks to hijack the cellular DNA and protein replication machinery. In the battle to escape the inevitability of senescence and programmed cell death, cancers have converged on similar mechanisms, through the acquisition and selection of somatic mutations that drive unchecked cellular replication in tumors. Understanding the dynamic mechanisms through which a minimal number of viral proteins promote host cells to undergo unscheduled and pathological replication is a powerful strategy to identify critical targets that are also disrupted in cancer. Viruses can therefore be used as tools to probe the system-wide protein-protein interactions and structures that drive growth deregulation in human cells. Ultimately this can provide a path for developing system context-dependent therapeutics. This review will describe ongoing experimental approaches using viruses to study pathways deregulated in cancer, with a particular focus on viral cellular protein-protein interactions and structures.",

			"abstract": "Vaccines represent a strategic successful tool used to prevent or contain diseases with high morbidity and/or mortality. However, while vaccines have proven to be effective in combating pathogenic microorganisms, based on the immune recognition of these foreign antigens, vaccines aimed at inducing effective antitumor activity are still unsatisfactory. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the two licensed cancer-preventive vaccines targeting tumor-associated viral agents (anti-HBV [hepatitis B virus], to prevent HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma, and anti-HPV [human papillomavirus], to prevent HPV-associated cervical carcinoma), along with the recent FDA approval of sipuleucel-T (for the therapeutic treatment of prostate cancer), represents a significant advancement in the field of cancer vaccines and a boost for new studies in the field. Specific active immunotherapies based on anticancer vaccines represent, indeed, a field in continuous evolution and expansion. Significant improvements may result from the selection of the appropriate tumor-specific target antigen (to overcome the peripheral immune tolerance) and/or the development of immunization strategies effective at inducing a protective immune response. This review aims to describe the vast spectrum of tumor antigens and strategies to develop cancer vaccines.",

			"abstract": "Half of prostate cancers harbor gene fusions between TMPRSS2 and members of the ETS transcription factor family. To date, little is known about the presence of non-ETS fusion events in prostate cancer. We used next-generation transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) in order to explore the whole transcriptome of 25 human prostate cancer samples for the presence of chimeric fusion transcripts. We generated more than 1 billion sequence reads and used a novel computational approach (FusionSeq) in order to identify novel gene fusion candidates with high confidence. In total, we discovered and characterized seven new cancer-specific gene fusions, two involving the ETS genes ETV1 and ERG, and four involving non-ETS genes such as CDKN1A (p21), CD9, and IKBKB (IKK-beta), genes known to exhibit key biological roles in cellular homeostasis or assumed to be critical in tumorigenesis of other tumor entities, as well as the oncogene PIGU and the tumor suppressor gene RSRC2. The novel gene fusions are found to be of low frequency, but, interestingly, the non-ETS fusions were all present in prostate cancer harboring the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion. Future work will focus on determining if the ETS rearrangements in prostate cancer are associated or directly predispose to a rearrangement-prone phenotype.",

			"abstract": "PIWIL2, a member of PIWI/AGO gene family, is expressed in the germline stem cells (GSCs) of testis for gametogenesis but not in adult somatic and stem cells. It has been implicated to play an important role in tumor development. We have previously reported that precancerous stem cells (pCSCs) constitutively express Piwil2 transcripts to promote their proliferation. Here we show that these transcripts de facto represent Piwil2-like (PL2L) proteins. We have identified several PL2L proteins including PL2L80, PL2L60, PL2L50 and PL2L40, using combined methods of Gene-Exon-Mapping Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (GEM RT-PCR), bioinformatics and a group of novel monoclonal antibodies. Among them, PL2L60 rather than Piwil2 and other PL2L proteins is predominantly expressed in various types of human and mouse tumor cells. It promotes tumor cell survival and proliferation in vitro through up-regulation of Stat3 and Bcl2 gene expressions, the cell cycle entry from G(0/1) into S-phase, and the nuclear expression of NF-\u03baB, which contribute to the tumorigenicity of tumor cells in vivo. Consistently, PL2L proteins rather than Piwil2 are predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm or cytoplasm and nucleus of euchromatin-enriched tumor cells in human primary and metastatic cancers, such as breast and cervical cancers. Moreover, nuclear PL2L proteins are always co-expressed with nuclear NF-\u03baB. These results reveal that PL2L60 can coordinate with NF-\u03baB to promote tumorigenesis and might mediate a common pathway for tumor development without tissue restriction. The identification of PL2L proteins provides a novel insight into the mechanisms of cancer development as well as a novel bridge linking cancer diagnostics and anticancer drug development.",

We describe a unique bioinformatics approach, ASCAT (allele-specific copy number analysis of tumors), to accurately dissect the allele-specific copy number of solid tumors, simultaneously estimating and adjusting for both tumor ploidy and nonaberrant cell admixture. This allows calculation of \"ASCAT profiles\" (genome-wide allele-specific copy-number profiles) from which gains, losses, copy number-neutral events, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) can accurately be determined. In an early-stage breast carcinoma series, we observe aneuploidy (>2.7n) in 45% of the cases and an average nonaberrant cell admixture of 49%. By aggregation of ASCAT profiles across our series, we obtain genomic frequency distributions of gains and losses, as well as genome-wide views of LOH and copy number-neutral events in breast cancer. In addition, the ASCAT profiles reveal differences in aberrant tumor cell fraction, ploidy, gains, losses, LOH, and copy number-neutral events between the five previously identified molecular breast cancer subtypes. Basal-like breast carcinomas have a significantly higher frequency of LOH compared with other subtypes, and their ASCAT profiles show large-scale loss of genomic material during tumor development, followed by a whole-genome duplication, resulting in near-triploid genomes. Finally, from the ASCAT profiles, we construct a genome-wide map of allelic skewness in breast cancer, indicating loci where one allele is preferentially lost, whereas the other allele is preferentially gained. We hypothesize that these alternative alleles have a different influence on breast carcinoma development.",

Intravenous transplantation of 2 of 2 ALL cell lines and 9 of 14 primary ALL cases generated leukemia-like proliferations in recipient mice by 1-7 months after transplant. Leukemias were retransplantable, and the immunophenotypes, gene rearrangements and expression profiles were identical or similar to those of the original primary samples. NOD-scid mice transplanted with the same primary samples developed similar leukemias with only a slightly longer latency than did NOD-scid-IL2Rg(-/-) mice. In this highly sensitive NOD-scid-IL2Rg(-/-)-based assay, 1-100 unsorted primary human ALL cells from five of five tested patients, four of whom eventually experienced leukemia relapse, generated leukemias in recipient mice. This very high frequency of LSCs suggests that a hierarchical LSC model is not valuable for poor-outcome ALL.",

			"abstract": "Recurrent chromosomal abnormalities, especially chromosomal translocations, are strongly associated with certain subtypes of leukemia, lymphoma and solid tumors. The appearance of particular translocations or associated genomic alterations can be important indicators of disease prognosis, and in some cases, certain translocations may indicate appropriate therapy protocols. To date, most of our knowledge about chromosomal translocations has derived from characterization of the highly selected recurrent translocations found in certain cancers. Until recently, mechanisms that promote or suppress chromosomal translocations, in particular, those responsible for their initiation, have not been addressed. For translocations to occur, two distinct chromosomal loci must be broken, brought together (synapsed) and joined. Here, we discuss recent findings on processes and pathways that influence the initiation of chromosomal translocations, including the generation fo DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) by general factors or in the context of the Lymphocyte-specific V(D)J and IgH class-switch recombination processes. We also discuss the role of spatial proximity of DSBs in the interphase nucleus with respect to how DSBs on different chromosomes are justaposed for joining. In addition, we discuss the DNA DSB response and its role in recognizing and tethering chromosomal DSBs to prevent translocations, as well as potential roles of the classical and alternative DSB end-joining pathways in suppressing or promoting translocations. Finally, we discuss the potential roles of long range regulatory elements, such as the 3'IgH enhancer complex, in promoting the expression of certain translocations that are frequent in lymphomas and, thereby, contributing to their frequent appearance in tumors.",

			"abstract": "Chondromyxoid fibroma (CMF) is an uncommon benign cartilaginous tumor of bone usually occurring during the second decade of life. CMF is associated with recurrent rearrangements of chromosome bands 6p23-25, 6q12-15, and 6q23-27. To delineate further the role and frequency of the involvement of three candidate regions (6q13, 6q23.3 and 6q24) in the pathogenesis of CMF, we studied a group of 43 cases using a molecular cytogenetic approach. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with probe sets bracketing the putative breakpoint regions was performed in 30 cases. The expression level of nearby candidate genes was studied by immunohistochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR in 24 and 23 cases, respectively. Whole-genome copy number screening was performed by array comparative genomic hybridization in 16 cases. Balanced and unbalanced rearrangements of 6q13 and 6q23.3 occurred in six and five cases, respectively, and a hemizygous deletion in 6q24 was found in five cases. Two known tumor suppressor genes map to the latter region: PLAGL1 and UTRN. However, neither of these two genes nor BCLAF1 and COL12A1, respectively located in 6q23.3 and 6q13, showed altered expression. Therefore, although rearrangements of chromosomal regions 6q13, 6q23.3, and 6q24 are common in CMF, the complexity of the changes precludes the use of a single fluorescence in situ hybridization probe set as an adjunct diagnostic tool. These data indicate that the genetic alterations in CMF are heterogeneous and are likely a result of a cryptic rearrangement beyond the resolution level of combined binary ratio fluorescence in situ hybridization or a point mutation.",

Wilms cells also express \"embryonic\" chromatin regulators and maintain stem cell-like p16 silencing. Finally, Wilms and ESCs both exhibit \"bivalent\" chromatin modifications at silent promoters that may be poised for activation. In Wilms tumor, bivalent promoters correlate to genes expressed in specific kidney compartments and point to a kidney-specific differentiation program arrested at an early-progenitor stage. We suggest that Wilms cells share a transcriptional and epigenetic landscape with a normal renal stem cell, which is inherently susceptible to transformation and may represent a cell of origin for this disease.",

			"abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with non-small-cell lung carcinomas in smokers being the predominant form of the disease. Although previous studies have identified important common somatic mutations in lung cancers, they have primarily focused on a limited set of genes and have thus provided a constrained view of the mutational spectrum. Recent cancer sequencing efforts have used next-generation sequencing technologies to provide a genome-wide view of mutations in leukaemia, breast cancer and cancer cell lines. Here we present the complete sequences of a primary lung tumour (60x coverage) and adjacent normal tissue (46x). Comparing the two genomes, we identify a wide variety of somatic variations, including >50,000 high-confidence single nucleotide variants. We validated 530 somatic single nucleotide variants in this tumour, including one in the KRAS proto-oncogene and 391 others in coding regions, as well as 43 large-scale structural variations. These constitute a large set of new somatic mutations and yield an estimated 17.7 per megabase genome-wide somatic mutation rate. Notably, we observe a distinct pattern of selection against mutations within expressed genes compared to non-expressed genes and in promoter regions up to 5 kilobases upstream of all protein-coding genes. Furthermore, we observe a higher rate of amino acid-changing mutations in kinase genes. We present a comprehensive view of somatic alterations in a single lung tumour, and provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, of distinct selective pressures present within the tumour environment.",

It is based on a model of genome evolution that suggests that the origin of complex phenotypic innovations will be accompanied by the emergence of such founder genes, the descendants of which can still be traced in extant organisms. The origin of multicellularity can be considered to be a macroevolutionary transition, for which new gene functions would have been required. Cancer should be tightly connected to multicellular life since it can be viewed as a malfunction of interaction between cells in a multicellular organism. A phylostratigraphic tracking of the origin of cancer genes should, therefore, also provide insights into the origin of multicellularity.",

To gain further insight into this key cellular behavior, we performed an in vivo screen for regulators of cell invasion through basement membranes, using the simple model of Caenorhabditis elegans anchor cell invasion, and identified 99 genes that promote invasion, including the genes encoding the chaperonin complex cct. Notably, most of these genes have not been previously implicated in invasive cell behavior. We characterized members of the cct complex and 11 other gene products, determining the distinct aspects of the invasive cascade that they regulate, including formation of a specialized invasive cell membrane and its ability to breach the basement membrane. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of the human orthologs of cct-5 and lit-1, which had not previously been implicated in cell invasion, reduced the invasiveness of metastatic carcinoma cells, suggesting that a conserved genetic program underlies cell invasion. These results increase our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of cell invasion and also provide new potential therapeutic targets to limit this behavior.",

			"abstract": "Under physiological conditions, cells receive fate-determining signals from their tissue surroundings, primarily in the form of polypeptide growth factors. Integration of these extracellular signals underlies tissue homeostasis. Although departure from homeostasis and tumor initiation are instigated by oncogenic mutations rather than by growth factors, the latter are the major regulators of all subsequent steps of tumor progression, namely clonal expansion, invasion across tissue barriers, angiogenesis, and colonization of distant niches. Here, we discuss the relevant growth factor families, their roles in tumor biology, as well as the respective downstream signaling pathways. Importantly, cancer-associated activating mutations that impinge on these pathways often relieve, in part, the reliance of tumors on growth factors. On the other hand, growth factors are frequently involved in evolvement of resistance to therapeutic regimens, which extends the roles for polypeptide factors to very late phases of tumor progression and offers opportunities for cancer therapy.",

			"abstract": "Generally, cancers may undergo the developmental stages of benign proliferation, precancer and invasive cancer. Identification of biomarkers that are expressed throughout the developmental stages will facilitate detection, prevention and therapy of cancer. Piwil2, a member of AGO/PIWI family of proteins, has been suggested to be associated with tumor development. Here we reported that piwil2 can be detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in various stages of human cervical squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas. Interestingly, piwil2 was also detected in some metaplastic epithelial cells as well as histologically \"normal\" appearing tissues adjacent to malignant lesions. While all the premalignant and malignant lesions expressed varying levels of piwil2, p16(INK4a) (p16), a surrogate indicator of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection, was detected in only 84.62% of the specimens. In Papanicolaou (Pap) test, piwil2 was also detected in atypical glandular cells (AGC), low-grade (LSIL) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), whereas p16 was not always concomitantly detected in the same specimens. The results suggest that piwil2 might play important roles throughout the process of cervical cancer development and have the potential to be used as a complementary marker for p16(INK4a). It is worth further study to improve the sensitivity and specificity of current screening methods for cervical cancers.",

The mutation substituted a leucine for a proline in the PSTAIRE helix, the central motif in the interaction of the cdk with its regulatory cyclin subunit. We demonstrate that whilst the mutant cdk2 is considerably impaired in stable cyclin association, it is still able to generate an active kinase that can functionally complement defective cdks in vivo. Molecular dynamic simulations and biophysical measurements indicate that the observed biochemical properties likely stem from increased flexibility within the cyclin-binding helix.",

			"abstract": "With the rapid development of new genetic measurement methods, several types of genetic alterations can be quantified in a high-throughput manner. While the initial focus has been on investigating each data set separately, there is an increasing interest in studying the correlation structure between two or more data sets. Multivariate methods based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) have been proposed for integrating paired genetic data sets. The high dimensionality of microarray data imposes computational difficulties, which have been addressed for instance by studying the covariance structure of the data, or by reducing the number of variables prior to applying the CCA. In this work, we propose a new method for analyzing high-dimensional paired genetic data sets, which mainly emphasizes the correlation structure and still permits efficient application to very large data sets. The method is implemented by translating a regularized CCA to its dual form, where the computational complexity depends mainly on the number of samples instead of the number of variables. The optimal regularization parameters are chosen by cross-validation. We apply the regularized dual CCA, as well as a classical CCA preceded by a dimension-reducing Principal Components Analysis (PCA), to a paired data set of gene expression changes and copy number alterations in leukemia.",

Mutations in genes involved in cellular signaling are common, and often shared by tumors that arise in distinct anatomical locations. Here we review the most important molecular changes in different cancers from the perspective of what should be analyzed on a routine basis in the clinic. The paradigms are EGFR mutations in adenocarcinoma of the lung that can be treated with gefitinib, KRAS mutations in colon cancer with respect to treatment with EGFR antibodies, and the use of gene-expression analysis for ER-positive, node-negative breast cancer patients with respect to chemotherapy options. Several other examples in both solid and hematological cancers are also provided. We focus on how disease subtypes can influence therapy and discuss the implications of the impending molecular diagnostic revolution from the point of view of the patients, clinicians, and the diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies. This paradigm shift is occurring first in cancer patient management and is likely to promote the application of these technologies to other diseases.",

			"abstract": "Comprehensive analysis of the cancer genome has become a standard approach to identifying new disease loci, and ultimately will guide therapeutic decisions. A key technology in this effort, single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, has been applied in hematologic malignancies to detect deletions, amplifications, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at high resolution. An inherent challenge of such studies lies in correctly distinguishing somatically acquired, cancer-specific lesions from patient-specific inherited copy number variations or segments of homozygosity. Failure to include appropriate normal DNA reference samples for each patient in retrospective or prospective studies makes it difficult to identify small somatic deletions not evident by standard cytogenetic analysis. In addition, the lack of proper controls can also lead to vastly overestimated frequencies of LOH without accompanying loss of DNA copies, so-called copy-neutral LOH. Here we use examples from patients with myeloid malignancies to demonstrate the superiority of matched tumor and normal DNA samples (paired studies) over multiple unpaired samples with respect to reducing false discovery rates in high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis. Comparisons between matched tumor and normal samples will continue to be critical as the field moves from high resolution array analysis to deep sequencing to detect abnormalities in the cancer genome.",

This reveals more clearly than before the extent to which many cancer genomes are rearranged and how much these rearrangements contribute to the mutational burden of epithelial tumors. In particular, there are probably many fusion genes, analogous to those found in leukemias, to be found in common cancers, such as breast carcinoma, and some of these will prove to be important in cancer diagnosis and treatment.",

			"abstract": "We have produced an evolutionary model for promoters, analogous to the commonly used synonymous/nonsynonymous mutation models for protein-coding sequences. Although our model, called Sunflower, relies on some simple assumptions, it captures enough of the biology of transcription factor action to show clear correlation with other biological features. Sunflower predicts a binding profile of transcription factors to DNA sequences, in which different factors compete for the same potential binding sites. The parametrized model simultaneously estimates a continuous measurement of binding occupancy across the genomic sequence for each factor. We can then introduce a localized mutation, rerun the binding model, and record the difference in binding profiles. A single mutation can alter interactions both upstream and downstream of its position due to potential overlapping binding sites, and our statistic captures this domino effect. Over evolutionary time, we observe a clear excess of low-scoring mutations fixed in promoters, consistent with most changes being neutral. However, this is not consistent across all promoters, and some promoters show more rapid divergence. This divergence often occurs in the presence of relatively constant protein-coding divergence. Interestingly, different classes of promoters show different sensitivity to mutations, with phosphorylation-related genes having promoters inherently more sensitive to mutations than immune genes. Although there have previously been a number of models attempting to handle transcription factor binding, Sunflower provides a richer biological model, incorporating weak binding sites and the possibility of competition. The results show the first clear correlations between such a model and evolutionary processes.",

We developed a systematic approach to characterize the spectrum of cancer-associated mRNA alterations through integration of transcriptomic and structural genomic data, and we applied this approach to generate new insights into melanoma biology. Using paired-end massively parallel sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) together with analyses of high-resolution chromosomal copy number data, we identified 11 novel melanoma gene fusions produced by underlying genomic rearrangements, as well as 12 novel readthrough transcripts. We mapped these chimeric transcripts to base-pair resolution and traced them to their genomic origins using matched chromosomal copy number information. We also used these data to discover and validate base-pair mutations that accumulated in these melanomas, revealing a surprisingly high rate of somatic mutation and lending support to the notion that point mutations constitute the major driver of melanoma progression. Taken together, these results may indicate new avenues for target discovery in melanoma, while also providing a template for large-scale transcriptome studies across many tumor types.",

			"abstract": "Due to growing throughput and shrinking cost, massively parallel sequencing is rapidly becoming an attractive alternative to microarrays for the genome-wide study of gene expression and copy number alterations in primary tumors. The sequencing of transcripts (RNA-Seq) should offer several advantages over microarray-based methods, including the ability to detect somatic mutations and accurately measure allele-specific expression. To investigate these advantages we have applied a novel, strand-specific RNA-Seq method to tumors and matched normal tissue from three patients with oral squamous cell carcinomas. Additionally, to better understand the genomic determinants of the gene expression changes observed, we have sequenced the tumor and normal genomes of one of these patients. We demonstrate here that our RNA-Seq method accurately measures allelic imbalance and that measurement on the genome-wide scale yields novel insights into cancer etiology. As expected, the set of genes differentially expressed in the tumors is enriched for cell adhesion and differentiation functions, but, unexpectedly, the set of allelically imbalanced genes is also enriched for these same cancer-related functions. By comparing the transcriptomic perturbations observed in one patient to his underlying normal and tumor genomes, we find that allelic imbalance in the tumor is associated with copy number mutations and that copy number mutations are, in turn, strongly associated with changes in transcript abundance. These results support a model in which allele-specific deletions and duplications drive allele-specific changes in gene expression in the developing tumor.",

We identify 158 regions of focal SCNA that are altered at significant frequency across several cancer types, of which 122 cannot be explained by the presence of a known cancer target gene located within these regions. Several gene families are enriched among these regions of focal SCNA, including the BCL2 family of apoptosis regulators and the NF-kappaBeta pathway. We show that cancer cells containing amplifications surrounding the MCL1 and BCL2L1 anti-apoptotic genes depend on the expression of these genes for survival.

Homozygous deletions in cancer genomes occur over recessive cancer genes, where they can confer selective growth advantage, and over fragile sites, where they are thought to reflect an increased local rate of DNA breakage. However, most homozygous deletions in cancer genomes are unexplained. Here we identified 2,428 somatic homozygous deletions in 746 cancer cell lines. These overlie 11% of protein-coding genes that, therefore, are not mandatory for survival of human cells. We derived structural signatures that distinguish between homozygous deletions over recessive cancer genes and fragile sites. Application to clusters of unexplained homozygous deletions suggests that many are in regions of inherent fragility, whereas a small subset overlies recessive cancer genes. The results illustrate how structural signatures can be used to distinguish between the influences of mutation and selection in cancer genomes. The extensive copy number, genotyping, sequence and expression data available for this large series of publicly available cancer cell lines renders them informative reagents for future studies of cancer biology and drug discovery.",

			"abstract": "Advances in high-throughput, genome-wide profiling technologies have allowed for an unprecedented view of the cancer genome landscape. Specifically, high-density microarrays and sequencing-based strategies have been widely utilized to identify genetic (such as gene dosage, allelic status, and mutations in gene sequence) and epigenetic (such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNA) aberrations in cancer. Although the application of these profiling technologies in unidimensional analyses has been instrumental in cancer gene discovery, genes affected by low-frequency events are often overlooked. The integrative approach of analyzing parallel dimensions has enabled the identification of (a) genes that are often disrupted by multiple mechanisms but at low frequencies by any one mechanism and (b) pathways that are often disrupted at multiple components but at low frequencies at individual components. These benefits of using an integrative approach illustrate the concept that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. As efforts have now turned toward parallel and integrative multidimensional approaches for studying the cancer genome landscape in hopes of obtaining a more insightful understanding of the key genes and pathways driving cancer cells, this review describes key findings disseminating from such high-throughput, integrative analyses, including contributions to our understanding of causative genetic events in cancer cell biology.",

			"abstract": "Multiple cell lines (estimated at 300-400) have been established from human small cell (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). These cell lines have been widely dispersed to and used by the scientific community worldwide, with over 8000 citations resulting from their study. However, there remains considerable skepticism on the part of the scientific community as to the validity of research resulting from their use. These questions center around the genomic instability of cultured cells, lack of differentiation of cultured cells and absence of stromal-vascular-inflammatory cell compartments. In this report we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the use of cell lines, address the issues of instability and lack of differentiation. Perhaps the most important finding is that every important, recurrent genetic and epigenetic change including gene mutations, deletions, amplifications, translocations and methylation-induced gene silencing found in tumors has been identified in cell lines and vice versa. These \"driver mutations\" represented in cell lines offer opportunities for biological characterization and application to translational research. Another potential shortcoming of cell lines is the difficulty of studying multistage pathogenesis in vitro. To overcome this problem, we have developed cultures from central and peripheral airways that serve as models for the multistage pathogenesis of tumors arising in these two very different compartments. Finally the issue of cell line contamination must be addressed and safeguarded against. A full understanding of the advantages and shortcomings of cell lines is required for the investigator to derive the maximum benefit from their use.",

We have identified rare, recurrent homozygous deletions of Kruppel-like Factor 4 (KLF4) in medulloblastoma using high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, digital karyotyping, and genomic real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Furthermore, we show that there is loss of physiological KLF4 expression in more than 40% of primary medulloblastomas both at the RNA and protein levels. Medulloblastoma cell lines drastically increase the expression of KLF4 in response to the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine and demonstrate dense methylation of the promoter CpG island by bisulfite sequencing. Methylation-specific PCR targeting the KLF4 promoter demonstrates CpG methylation in approximately 16% of primary medulloblastomas. Reexpression of KLF4 in the D283 medulloblastoma cell line results in significant growth suppression both in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that KLF4 is inactivated by either genetic or epigenetic mechanisms in a large subset of medulloblastomas and that it likely functions as a tumor suppressor gene in the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma.",

Inactivation of CDK inhibitors predisposes mice to tumor development, showing that these genes function as tumor suppressors. Here, we describe high-throughput murine leukemia virus insertional mutagenesis screens in mice that are deficient for one or two CDK inhibitors. We retrieved 9,117 retroviral insertions from 476 lymphomas to define hundreds of loci that are mutated more frequently than expected by chance. Many of these loci are skewed toward a specific genetic context of predisposing germline and somatic mutations. We also found associations between these loci with gender, age of tumor onset, and lymphocyte lineage (B or T cell). Comparison of retroviral insertion sites with single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia revealed a significant overlap between the datasets. Together, our findings highlight the importance of genetic context within large-scale mutation detection studies, and they show a novel use for insertional mutagenesis data in prioritizing disease-associated genes that emerge from genome-wide association studies.",

To assess the current status of translational research in cancer genetics, we analyzed the extramural grant portfolio of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) from Fiscal Year 2007, as well as the cancer genetic research articles published in 2007. We classified both funded grants and publications as follows: T0 as discovery research; T1 as research to develop a candidate health application (e.g., test or therapy); T2 as research that evaluates a candidate application and develops evidence-based recommendations; T3 as research that assesses how to integrate an evidence-based recommendation into cancer care and prevention; and T4 as research that assesses health outcomes and population impact. We found that 1.8% of the grant portfolio and 0.6% of the published literature was T2 research or beyond. In addition to discovery research in cancer genetics, a translational research infrastructure is urgently needed to methodically evaluate and translate gene discoveries for cancer care and prevention.",

Here we use a paired-end sequencing strategy to identify somatic rearrangements in breast cancer genomes. There are more rearrangements in some breast cancers than previously appreciated. Rearrangements are more frequent over gene footprints and most are intrachromosomal. Multiple rearrangement architectures are present, but tandem duplications are particularly common in some cancers, perhaps reflecting a specific defect in DNA maintenance. Short overlapping sequences at most rearrangement junctions indicate that these have been mediated by non-homologous end-joining DNA repair, although varying sequence patterns indicate that multiple processes of this type are operative. Several expressed in-frame fusion genes were identified but none was recurrent. The study provides a new perspective on cancer genomes, highlighting the diversity of somatic rearrangements and their potential contribution to cancer development.",

			"abstract": "Cancer is driven by mutation. Worldwide, tobacco smoking is the principal lifestyle exposure that causes cancer, exerting carcinogenicity through >60 chemicals that bind and mutate DNA. Using massively parallel sequencing technology, we sequenced a small-cell lung cancer cell line, NCI-H209, to explore the mutational burden associated with tobacco smoking. A total of 22,910 somatic substitutions were identified, including 134 in coding exons. Multiple mutation signatures testify to the cocktail of carcinogens in tobacco smoke and their proclivities for particular bases and surrounding sequence context. Effects of transcription-coupled repair and a second, more general, expression-linked repair pathway were evident. We identified a tandem duplication that duplicates exons 3-8 of CHD7 in frame, and another two lines carrying PVT1-CHD7 fusion genes, indicating that CHD7 may be recurrently rearranged in this disease. These findings illustrate the potential for next-generation sequencing to provide unprecedented insights into mutational processes, cellular repair pathways and gene networks associated with cancer.",

A subset of these somatic alterations, termed driver mutations, confer selective growth advantage and are implicated in cancer development, whereas the remainder are passengers. Here we have sequenced the genomes of a malignant melanoma and a lymphoblastoid cell line from the same person, providing the first comprehensive catalogue of somatic mutations from an individual cancer. The catalogue provides remarkable insights into the forces that have shaped this cancer genome. The dominant mutational signature reflects DNA damage due to ultraviolet light exposure, a known risk factor for malignant melanoma, whereas the uneven distribution of mutations across the genome, with a lower prevalence in gene footprints, indicates that DNA repair has been preferentially deployed towards transcribed regions. The results illustrate the power of a cancer genome sequence to reveal traces of the DNA damage, repair, mutation and selection processes that were operative years before the cancer became symptomatic.",

			"abstract": "Urothelium, one of the slowest cycling epithelia in the body, embodies a unique biological context for cellular transformation. Introduction of oncogenes into or removing tumor suppressor genes from the urothelial cells or a combination of both using the transgenic and/or knockout mouse approaches has provided useful insights into the molecular mechanisms of urothelial transformation and tumorigenesis. It is becoming increasingly clear that over-activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathway, as exemplified by the constitutively activated Ha-ras oncogene, is both necessary and sufficient to initiate the low-grade, non-invasive urothelial carcinomas. Dosage of the mutated Ha-ras, but not concurrent inactivation of pro-senescence molecules p16Ink4a and p19Arf, dictates whether and when the low-grade urothelial carcinomas arise. Inactivation of both p53 and pRb, a prevailing paradigm previously proposed for muscle-invasive urothelial tumorigenesis, is found to be necessary but insufficient to initiate this urothelial carcinoma variant. Instead, downregulation in p53/pRb co-deficient urothelial cells of p107, a pRb family member, is associated with the genesis of the muscle-invasive bladder cancers. p53 deficiency also seems to be capable of cooperating with that of PTEN in eliciting invasive urothelial carcinomas. The genetically engineered mice have improved the molecular definition of the divergent pathways of urothelial tumorigenesis and progression, helped delineate the intricate crosstalk among different genetic alterations within a urothelium-specific context, identified new prognostic markers and novel therapeutic targets potentially applicable for clinical intervention, and provided in vivo platforms for testing preventive strategies of bladder cancer.",

However, heterogeneous breast tumors provide a unique opportunity to study human tumor progression because they still contain evidence of early and intermediate subpopulations in the form of the phylogenetic relationships. We have developed a method we call Sector-Ploidy-Profiling (SPP) to study the clonal composition of breast tumors. SPP involves macro-dissecting tumors, flow-sorting genomic subpopulations by DNA content, and profiling genomes using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Breast carcinomas display two classes of genomic structural variation: (1) monogenomic and (2) polygenomic. Monogenomic tumors appear to contain a single major clonal subpopulation with a highly stable chromosome structure. Polygenomic tumors contain multiple clonal tumor subpopulations, which may occupy the same sectors, or separate anatomic locations. In polygenomic tumors, we show that heterogeneity can be ascribed to a few clonal subpopulations, rather than a series of gradual intermediates. By comparing multiple subpopulations from different anatomic locations, we have inferred pathways of cancer progression and the organization of tumor growth.",

			"abstract": "The prime objective for every life form is to deliver its genetic material, intact and unchanged, to the next generation. This must be achieved despite constant assaults by endogenous and environmental agents on the DNA. To counter this threat, life has evolved several systems to detect DNA damage, signal its presence and mediate its repair. Such responses, which have an impact on a wide range of cellular events, are biologically significant because they prevent diverse human diseases. Our improving understanding of DNA-damage responses is providing new avenues for disease management.",

			"abstract": "Somatic mutations must happen often during development because of the large number of cell divisions to expand from a single-cell zygote to a full organism. A mutation in development carries forward to all descendant cells, causing genetic mosaicism. Widespread genetic mosaicism may influence diseases that derive from a few genetically altered cells, such as cancer. I show how to predict the expected amount of mosaicism and the variation in mosaicism between individuals. I then calculate the predicted risk of cancer derived from developmental mutations. The calculations show that a significant fraction of cancer in later life likely arises from developmental mutations in early life. In addition, much of the variation in the risk of cancer between individuals may arise from variation in the degree of genetic mosaicism set in early life. I also suggest that certain types of neurodegeneration, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), may derive from a small focus of genetically altered cells. If so, then the risk of ALS would be influenced by developmental mutations and the consequent variation in genetic mosaicism. New technologies promise the ability to measure genetic mosaicism by sampling a large number of cellular genomes within an individual. The sampling of many genomes within an individual will eventually allow one to reconstruct the cell lineage history of genetic change in a single body. Somatic evolutionary genomics will follow from this technology, providing new insight into the origin and progression of disease with increasing age.",

This has resulted from increased knowledge of the human genome, which has contributed to the unraveling of molecular pathways in health and disease. Exploitation of this information has allowed it to be used for practical diagnostic purposes. The aim of the first part of this two-part review is to provide an up-to-date review of molecular genetic investigations that are available and routinely used by specialist musculoskeletal histopathologists in the diagnosis of neoplastic disease. Herein we focus on the benefits of employing well characterized somatic mutations in soft tissue lesions that are commonly employed in diagnostic pathology today. The second part highlights the known somatic and germline mutations implicated in osteoclast-rich lesions of bone, and the genetic changes that disturb phosphate metabolism and result in a variety of musculoskeletal phenotypes. Finally, a brief practical guide of how to use and provide a molecular pathology service is given.",

Here we test the idea of a link between aneuploidy and mutations allowing improved growth, using Saccharomyces cerevisiae containing a mcm4 helicase allele that was shown to cause cancer in mice. Yeast bearing this mcm4 allele are prone to undergoing a \"hypermutable phase\" characterized by a changing karyotype, ultimately yielding progeny with improved growth properties. When such progeny are returned to a normal karyotype by mating, their improved growth remains. Genetic analysis shows their improved growth is due to mutations in just a few loci. In sum, the effects of the mcm4 allele in mice are recapitulated in yeast, and the aneuploidy is not required to maintain improved growth.",
